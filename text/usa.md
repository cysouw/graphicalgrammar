## Bloomfield (1933) *Language*

[@bloomfield1933: 161]

## Pike (1943) *Taxemes and immediate constituents*

[@pike1943: 70], citing bloomfield

## Nida (1946) *Morphology*

[@nida1949: 87]

## Wells (1947) *Immediate constituents*

[@wells1947: 84]

## Mikuš (1947) *Le Syntagme EST-IL Binaire?*

Francis Mikuš from Ljubljana

trees following Wundt [@mikus1947: 37], includes "chines boxes" diagram, without attribution.

## Fries (1952) *The structure of English*

[@fries1952: 272] (Pike is a student of Fries, Fries might have been inspired by Pike 1943 here)

## Bar-Hillel (1953) *A Quasi-Arithmetical Notation for Syntactic Description*

[@barhillel1953] english explanation of [@ajdukiewicz1935]

## Gleason (1955) *An introduction to descriptive linguistics*

[@gleason1955: 129-131]

second edition from 1961 extended, Chomsky mentioned in introduction [@gleason1961]. Includes generation and transformation. But still the old IC-stuff as well [@gleason1961]

[@gleason1965] very open description: Ch7 on Reed/Kellog and other approaches, but also many chapters on TGG

## Chomsky (1955) *The logical structure of linguistic theory*

[@chomsky1955]

Chomsky (1955: 277) Note the reversal of the usage of dashes, here more alike to brackets. The dashes seem to represent some kind of intonation structure, though.

Chomsky (1955: 316b) Similar to Pike/Fries/Hockett

Chomsky cites Bar-Hillel (1953: 57)

## Robert (1956) *Patterns of English*

completely idiosyncratic system of letters and numbers. No references whatsoever [@roberts1956].

## Smith (1957) *Superfixes and syntactic markers*

[@smith1957]

## Hockett (1958) *A course in modern linguistics*

[@hockett1958: 152]

## Francis (1958) *The structure of American English*

[@francis1958] chinese boxes. Stewart [@stewart1976] reports from personal communication with Francis, that the chinese-box diagrams were inspired on the graphical display in [@fries1952]

## Nida (1960) *A synopsis of English syntax*

[@nida1960] added images to 1943 dissertation, which did not have images

Nida (1973[1960]) writes his thesis in 1943, which is published in 1960. There do not seem to be trees in his thesis, but he Immediate Constituents might imply trees (but difficult to follow). In the 1960 edition he adds a long list of trees. But this is of course after Chomsky 1957.

In the preface of the 1943: 30 dissertation he cited Sheffield 1912 (though not with respect to structural analysis) 

Note the combination of dependency and constituency!

## Gammon (1963) *On representing syntactic structure*

[@gammon1963], completely ignoring chomsky?

## Nida (1964) *Toward a Science of Translating*
