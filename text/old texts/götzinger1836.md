### Max Wilhelm Götzinger *Die deutsche Sprache* [-@gotzinger1836] {#sec:götzinger1836}

Max Wilhelm Götzinger (1799–1856) was a teacher of German, most of his life working in Schaffhausen (Switzerland). He wrote extensively about grammar, literature and dialectology, see Olsson [-@olsson2009] for an comprehensive appraisal of his work. Besides his didactic writings, Götzinger also provided material for Grimm's dictionary project [@olsson2009: 37] and he was even awarded a doctorate *honoris causa* from the University of Basel in 1838 [@olsson2009: 36], probably through his personal contact with Wilhelm Wackernagel (the father of Jacob Wackernagel of *Wackernagel's law*-fame).

Götzinger wrote two didactic grammatical textbooks, both of which appeared in many different editions throughout the 19th Century [see @olsson2009: 42-46 for a list of all editions]. The book *Die Anfangsgründe der deutschen Sprachlehre in Regeln und Aufgaben* was first published in Leipzig in 1825. This was followed in quick succession by the *Deutsche Sprachlehre für Schulen*, first published in 1827 in Aarau. Originally, both these books did not contain any graphical analyses of sentences. A few years later, when revising his didactic grammars once again, he included graphical displays as discussed below, both in the fifth edition of the *Deutsche Sprachlehre* [@gotzinger1842: 222-226, 287-291] and in the fifth edition of the *Anfängsgründe* [@gotzinger1845: 236-242].

There is a curious graphic in the first edition of the *Deutsche Sprachlehre für Schulen* [@gotzinger1827: 263], reproduced here in [@fig:götzinger1827_263]. This graphical display purports to show different ways in which clauses can be coordinated to form a *Periode*. Although he lists various literary examples of such structures [@gotzinger1827: 264], it remains unclear how exactly this analysis is supposed to work. From the graphic it appears as if there should always be a central pair of clauses, but there is no explanation how to extract this central pair. The examples in the text seem to illustrate coordinated structures with a single central clause. For example, [@next] illustrates the option *Viergliedrig c)*, but this one clearly has the principal clause at the end.

A decade after the first editions of his textbooks Götzinger writes his magnum opus *Die deutsche Sprache und ihre Literatur* [volume one -@gotzinger1836; volume two -@gotzinger1839]. This book includes various graphical analyses, which are clearly inspired by the *Periodenbilder* from Lehmann (see [@sec:lehmann1833]). Götzinger does not explicitly cite Lehmann as his inspiration for the graphical display, but he mentions Lehmann's *vortreffliches Buch* ('excellent book') in a different context [@gotzinger1839: 217]. In a later preface to a different book he explicitly explains how he adapted and extended Lehmann's display [@gotzinger1842: vi].

Summarising, Lehmann (see [@sec:lehmann1833]) used a capital letter for a main clause and lower-case letters for subordinate clauses. Depending on position, there are three different methods to depict subordination. First, a subordinate clause in front of the main clause is separated by a colon. Second, a subordinate clause after the main clause is written below the main clause with a horizontal brace. Third, a clause-internal subordinate clause is written in round brackets.

Lehmann used his graphical method only for subordinated clauses, but Götzinger argues that the same idea of subordination (*Unterordnung*) can be used for other kinds of linguistic structure as well. Consequently, Götzinger uses Lehmann's notation also for (i) syllabic structure, (ii) clause-internal structure and (iii) clause subordination.

> *Auf diese Weiße ordnet die Sprache bei allen Vorgängen den jedesmaligen Stoff so, daß ein Theil desselben als untergeordnet erscheint, in der Silbe die Laute, im Worte die Silben, im Satze die Worte, in der Periode die Sätze.* [@gotzinger1836: 15]
> 
> ('Accordingly, language arranges the particular content in all occurrences in such a way that one part of it appears as subordinated: with syllables the sounds, with words the syllables, with clauses the words, with sentences the clauses.')

First, for the analysis of the syllable, Götzinger [-@gotzinger1836: 221-224] uses the capital letter for the vowel as the centre of the syllable (*Träger und Mittelpunkt der Silbe*) and lower-case letters for the consontants as dependent on the vowel (*erscheint stets als untergeordnet*). As long as the syllabic structure is according to the sonority hierarchy (*musikalisches Gesetz*), it can be described as (multiple) prefixal and suffixal subordinations, as illustrated in [@fig:götzinger1836_223]. Extrasyllabic initial *s* and affricate codas *ps*, *tsch* and *chs* are illustrated with different structures not repeated here [@gotzinger1836: 224].

> *In der Regel findet bei der Gliederung der Silbe durch fortschreitende Unterordnung der Elemente ein Schwellen und Sinken, ein Steigen und Fallen, ein Crescendo und Decrescendo statt; d.h. die Silbe fängt mit dem lautlosesten Element an, geht zu dem tönenenden über, gelangt zur eigentlichen Stimme, und geht nun denselben Weg wieder abwärts, so daß mithin in jeder auf diese Weiße gebaute Silbe ein völlig musikalisisches Gesetz statt findet.* [@gotzinger1836: 222]
> 
> ('Normally, the arrangement of the syllable consists, by repeated subordination of the elements, of swelling and sinking, of rising and falling, of crescendo and decrescendo; i.e. the syllable starts with the most silent element, proceeds to the more sounding one, reaches the principal voice, and then follows the same path downwards again in such a way that each such constructed syllable obeys a completely musical law.')

![Syllables with a structure in accordance to the sonority hierarchy [@gotzinger1836: 223] have a vowel as nucleus (capital letter) and possibly multiple 'subordinate' consonants in the onset (lower-case letters separated horizontally with colons) and the coda (lower-case letters separated vertically with braces).](figures/götzinger1836_223.png){#fig:götzinger1836_223}

Second, for the analysis of the internal structure of a clause, Götzinger proposes to use the same notation [@gotzinger1839: 159-162]. A few examples are shown in [@fig:götzinger1839_161]. The capital letter now refers to the verb and the lower-case letters refer to the constituents. Götzinger calls the lower-cased elements *Bekleidung* (cf. the discussion in [@sec:billroth1832]). Today a German grammar would call them *Satzglied*. The German main clause structure with two verb positions is indicated by a repeated capital letter, called *trennbare Zusammensetzung* by Götzinger [-@gotzinger1839: 160]. Similar terminology can still be found in contemporaneous German grammars.

Relative to the main verb, the three possible positions of the *Bekleidung* (i.e. before, in between and after the verb) are called *Voraussendung, Anfügung, Einschiebung*, respectively [@gotzinger1839: 160]. They are indicated with a colon, a horizontal brace and round brackets in the tradition of Lehmann (see [@sec:lehmann1833]), who calls them *Vorausschickung, Anfügung* and *Einschaltung*. Today a German grammar would say *Vorfeld, Nachfeld* and *Mittelfeld*. Götzinger also observes one of the main generalisation of German main clause structure, namely that the *Voraussendung/Vorfeld* never consists of more than one *Bekleidung/Satzglied*. 

> *Mag also die Stellung der Bekleidung in jenem Satze seyn, wie sie will, immer wird nur das Bild entstehen [mit einer Voraussendung]. Niemals kann die Folge vorkommen [mit mehreren Voraussendungen].* [@gotzinger1839: 162]
>
> ('Although the position of the constituents in the sentence can be as it chooses, the resulting image will always have a single *Vorraussendung*. The ordering with multiple *Voraussendungen* cannot occur.')

![Main clause analysis from Götzinger [-@gotzinger1839: 161] using the same notation as for syllables. In modern grammatical terminology: the main verb is indicated by the capital letter, possibly two times in case of a separated verb. Other *Satzglieder* are indicated by lower-case letters. The *Vorfeld* is separated by a colon. The *Mittelfeld* is put between round brackets, with multiple constituents separated by commas. The *Nachfeld* is indicated below the horizontal brace, again with commas separating mulitple constituents.](figures/götzinger1839_161.png){#fig:götzinger1839_161}

Third, for the analysis of the multi-clause sentence (*Periode*)

subordination: 364-367, 371, Periode: 374-403

coordination (*Beiordnung*) with an equal sign (p.366)
He observes, that with multiple subordinate clauses there are examples that appear to have an empty second part of the main predicate, or, in modern terminology, an empty *rechte Satzklammer*. He uses a dash to indicate such zeros. (p.381)
