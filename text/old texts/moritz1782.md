### Karl Philipp Moritz: *Deutsche Sprachlehre* [-@moritz1782] {#sec:moritz1782}

Karl Philipp Moritz (1756-1793) was a prolific author with wide ranging interests. Towards the end of his life he became professor for the arts at the *Königliche Akademie der Künste* in Berlin. Among his many writings there are various instructional books and articles about grammar, see Schmidt [-@schmidt1993] for a concise summary of his linguistic oeuvre. Of particular interest here is the *Deutsche Sprachlehre für die Damen in Briefen* [@moritz1782]. The context and linguistic content of this work is discussed in more detail by Buhofer [-@buhofer1994]. This book was quite successful, being reprinted in 1791, 1794 and 1806. All later editions dropped the somewhat curious addition *für die Damen* from the title.

The *Deutsche Sprachlehre* contains to my knowledge the first graphical display of a grammatical analysis. In the *Zehnter Brief: Von dem Bau der Rede*, starting on page 267, Moritz discusses various simple examples, culminating in two large fold-out page-inserts between pages 308 and 309, reproduced here in [@fig:moritz1782i] and [@fig:moritz1782ii]. Later, in the first volume of his 1793 *Grammatisches Wörterbuch der deutschen Sprache* there is a short summary of this grammatical analysis under the heading of *Construcktion* [@moritz1793: 283-295]. After Moritz' early demise that same year (at only 37 years of age) this *Grammatisches Wörterbuch* was completed by other authors without any further mentioning of this new kind of sentence analysis. The most extensive exposition of Moritz' envisioned analysis thus remains the discussion in the 1782 *Deutsche Sprachlehre*.

Moritz' linguistic analysis is particularly noteworthy because it is an early version of what later will be called a *Satzgliedanalyse* ('phrasal analysis'). Although Moritz consistently talks about the "words" of the sentence, he clearly intends these "words" to be something closer to what today would be called phrases. These phrases are classified into various functions, using German labels for didactic purposes (e.g. *Grund*=subject, *Ziel*=accusative object, *Zweck*=dative indirect object). Forsgren [@forsgren1985: 76], discussing the origin of such phrasal analyses at the end of the 18th Century, argues that Moritz' approach is one of the earliest examples of a phrasal analysis and his ideas appears to be developed independently from other contemporaries.

Examining the details of this visual display, each clause can be identified by a large bracket. Within each clausal bracket there is a table-like structure with function-names on top and the actual words of the clause below. Each clause consists of *Grund* ("subject") and *Rede* ("predicate"), with possibly additional syntactic functions like *Ziel* ("accusative object"), *Zweck* ("dative object") or *Bindung* ("conjunction"). Optional elements like *Hinanfügung* ("adverbial phrase") and *Einschiebung* ("interjection") are placed loosely below the main syntactic functions, implicitly hinting at an argument/adjunct distinction. Various details are not completely thought through and the examples are sometimes slightly inconsistent. For example, the phrase *von der Schulter* in clause 11 is analyzed as an adverbial *Hinanfügung*, while the completely parallel *auf die Schulter* in clause 18 is analyzed as an object-like *zweites Ziel*.

More interesting is the treatment of subordinate clauses. Subordinate clauses are given a function in the matrix clause and then are further analyzed within a new bracket as a separate clause below. This can be seen in [@fig:moritz1782ii] with the analysis of direct speech in clause 13, which is the *Ziel* of the matrix clause 12. Likewise, the adverbial *um zu+Infinitiv* subordinate clause 21 is the *Zweck* of the matrix clause 20. 

This display of subordinate clauses is no coincidence. In the text there is an explicit discussion of this analysis of subordinate clauses [@moritz1782: 299-300] based on the example sentence [@next]. This sentence is analyzed by Moritz into four separate clauses. The four clauses and their functions in the superordinate clause are listed in [@next a-d], as shown in [@fig:moritz1782sub1]. Each of these subordinate clauses is subsequently analyzed using the same clausal analysis structure as the superordinate clause, as can be seen in [@fig:moritz1782sub2].

Nitpicking one might argue that this analysis of the complex sentence is not completely correct. Clause 2 from [@fig:moritz1782sub2] is not a separate clause but the superordinate clause itself. Further, The subordinate part *um vergnügt und glücklich zu sein* is analyzed in [@fig:moritz1782sub1] as *Zweck* ('reason', confusingly a label otherwise also used for dative arguments by Moritz). However, this clause is not directly subordinate to the main clause *so fühle ich* but it is secondary subordinate to the *Ziel* complement clause *daß mir dieses genug ist*. 

Notwithstanding these inaccuracies, Moritz' analysis shows a clear understanding of subordinate clauses simultaneously having an internal functional structure and, as a whole clause, having a function inside a superordinate structure. Anachronistically interpreting this as a constituency analysis, this sentence can be displayed as shown in [@fig:moritz1782_300tree]. Note that this is somewhat akin to an "underlying" structure as the ordering does not correspond to the original sentence. Moritz consistently applies the same functional structure on each clause (viz. the ordering *Grund-Rede-Ziel-Zweck-Hinanfügung*). The numbering in this examples indicates the eventual ordering in the resulting sentence.

Summarizing, Moritz appears to have a clear understanding of, first, phrases as the basis of syntactic analysis. Second, he assigns a syntactic function to each phrase. Third, his examples indicate a basic, through rather implicit, understanding of adjuncts as less crucial phrases (*Hinanfügung*) that are visually displayed below the main constituents. Fourth, subordinate clauses have their own clausal structure, while the subordinate as a whole is assigned a function in the superordinate clause, which is a clear precursor of constituency structure. Finally, in the text he explicitly mentions that the ordering of the elements in the actual sentence is slightly different from the ordering in his analyses, and he hints at rules that determine how the abstract "underlying" structure has to be reordered into the actual form.

All these theoretical concepts are quite charmingly summarized by his graphical display, which can be interpreted as a kind of constituency structure. Apparently appearing completely out of the blue, the idea of using graphics to elucidate grammatical structure is off to a great start with these proposals from Moritz' *Deutsche Sprachlehre*. Unfortunately, his approach does not have had any following and it would take another 50 years for graphical methods to be used again for grammatical analysis.
