## Syntactic tables

Note tables in [@becker1830: 253-261]

### James (1847) *The elements of grammar*

"construction" in table-like manner like Becker 1830 [@james1847: 133-134]

### Morell (1852) *The analysis of sentences*

Morell [@morell1857; @morell1852] is based on Becker 1829! But simplifies into tables, and removes ordering. Tables become widespread in GB

table p24-25, complex sentence p41

### Swinton (1872) *A progressive grammar of the English tongue*

William Swinton (1833-1892) in USA, but no diagram - more likely britisch tradition

tabular based on Becker [@swinton1872: 154]

Swinton (1872: iii-iv) “The introduction, some thirty years ago, of the method of Sentential Analysis, devised by the German philologist Becker, and adapted to American school use in the meritorious works of Professor Greene and others, marks the only considerable innovation, in this country, on the Murray system.”

He writes many versions of grammars and textbooks, but never uses diagramming. He cites many GB-grammars (p. viii), so this work seems to belong more in that tradition

### Morris (1877) *English grammar*

Also USA, but only using tables [@morris1877: 100-111]

### Mason (1881) *English grammar*

first edition [@mason1858] no tables
25th edition [@mason1881: 183-185] with tables (fold-out appendix after p268)

### Fitch (1881) *Lectures on teaching*

long-form analysis like becker [@fitch1881: 268-269]

### Meiklejohn (1882) *The standard grammar*

graphical display "mapping" [@meiklejohn1882: 20, 22, 147, 168-169]

"mapping out" = diagramming? [@meiklejohn1886: 92, 97-98]
"continuous analysis = Becker-style? [@meiklejohn1886: 99]
tables p.98

### Cooper & Sonnenschein (1891) *An English grammar for schools*
