## Broberg (1882) *Manuel de la langue danoise*

Severin Carl Olfert Fischer Broberg (1822-1900) was a danish author and occasional lecturer at the Universities of Randers and Odense. He wrote a Danish language guide for French speakers, called *Manuel de la langue danoise* [@broberg1882]. To explain the Danish sentence structure he used a special graphical technique of an indented table [@broberg1882: 95-102]. There is no indication towards any inspiration that might have led Broberg to propose this kind of analysis.

Repeated here is one of Broberg's Danish example sentence in [@next a], with his own French translation [@next b] and an additional English translation by me [@next c]. Broberg's graphical analysis is shown in [@fig:broberg1882_95]. The basic sentence *Datter viste et Maleri* 'Daughter showed a painting' is shown in bold typeface at the left side of the tabular display. All modifier phrases are shown below their head phrases, indented to the right. The order of the phrases from top to bottom reflects their modification order. For example, *Datter* 'daughter' is first modified by *ældste* 'oldest' and then by *Generalens* 'of the general'. However, the order of these elements in a Danish sentence is reversed: the real order in which the words occur in the Danish sentence is indicated by the numbers in the table.

::: ex
- Generalens ældste Datter viste, for at give Samtalen en anden Vending, en af Gjæsterne et fra Kjøbenhavn ankommet, en læsende Hyrde forestillende Maleri.
- La fille aînée du général, pour faire diversion à l'entretien, montra à l'un des convives un tableau venu de Copenhague et représentant un berger lisant.
- The general's eldest daughter, to give the conversation a different turn, showed one of the guests a painting that had arrived from Copenhagen, depicting a reading shepherd.

Indented table by Broberg [-@broberg1882: 95] to explain the sentence structure of the Danish example sentence in [@last a]. The actual order of the words is indicated by the numbers. The top to bottom order in the table indicates relative modification, i.e. each indented phrase modifies the head phrase above it.

## Beckman (1904) *Svensk Språklära* {#sec:beckman1904}

Karl Frederik Natanael Beckman (1868-1946) professor of Scandinavian languages at Gothenburg University [@beckman1904a: 194-198, 202, 219]

cites Kern and Lindwall (p. 273)

his school textbooks do not seem to have been noticed?

Beckman studied in Uppsala, where he received his doctor’s degree and became a lecturer in 1895.
In 1918, he was appointed professor of Scandinavian languages in Gothenburg, a post he retained until 1935. But Beckman was also headmaster at a high school, and several of his contributions were thus pedagogical in nature. He created popular textbooks that were reprinted many times, for example his study of Swedish metrics (1898) and especially his Svensk språklära för den högre elementarundervisningen (A Swedish Grammar for Higher Elementary Schools, 1904). He also studied the ongoing disappearance of plural verb forms in Swedish, the peculiar relations between social rank and personal pronouns in Sweden, and the syntactic phenomena that had spread across linguistic borders in Western European, such as the definite article and the perfect tense. p. 247-248

## Setälä & Nieminen (1946) *Suomen kielen oppikirja*

Eemil Nestor Setälä (1864-1935) was a well-known Finnish politician and author of the Finnish declaration of independence. However, he was also a professor for Finnish language and literature at Helsinki University and among many other grammatical works he wrote a little booklet *Suomen kielen oppikirja* 'Finnisch language textbook'. The first edition appeared in 1898 and has been reprinted various time. The version from 1925, that I have consulted, does not have any graphical analyses [@setala1925].

Kaarlo Nieminen (1887-1955) was a Finnish language teacher, later lecturer and professor at Helsinki University. After the death of Setälä he revised the *Suomen kielen oppikirja* in 1939. This revision was also reprinted many times. The version from 1946, that I have consulted, has an interesting graphical analysis for the example sentence in [@next] as shown in [@fig:setälä1946_68] [@setala1946: 68]. It is unclear whether this approach with arrows for modification has any precursors, or whether this is an original idea from Nieminen:

> Lauseenosien keskinäisiä suhteita voidaan havainnollistaa piirroksen avulla. Jos merkitsemme subjektin paksulla pystysuoralla viivalla, predikaatin siitä lähtevällä paksulla vaakasuoralla viivalla, kumpaisenkin määräykset niihin vinosti suuntautuvilla ohuemmilla viivoilla sekä määräysten määräykset taas niihin suuntautuvilla viivoilla. [@setala1946: 68]
> 
> ('The mutual relations of the parts of a sentence can be illustrated by means of a drawing. If we mark the subject with a thick vertical line, the predicate with a thick horizontal line extending from it, the modifiers of each with thinner lines directed at them diagonally, and the modifiers of the modifiers again with lines directed at them.')

Dependency graph with arrows for the example sentence in [@last] from Setälä & Nieminen [-@setala1946: 68]. The diagonal placement of the arrows is faintly reminiscent of the USA-style diagramming, but the details of the positioning are completely different. This display might very well be an innovation by Nieminen.
:::

Aulis Ojajärvi (1913-1968) was a language teacher and in 1964, after the death of Kaarlo Nieminen, he once again revised the *Suomen kielen oppikirja*. The version from 1970, that I have consulted, is rather different from earlier versions and contains completely different graphical analyses [@setala1970]. The structure from the examples sentence [@next] is illustrated in two different ways in [@fig:setälä1970_77]. The upper version is strongly reminiscent of the visualisation of Beckman (see [@sec:beckman1904]). The lower display is structurally identical, but the words are placed in their regular sentence order.

::: {.im #setälä1970_77}
Two different visualisations of the structure of the example in [@last] from Setälä, Nieminen & Ojajärvi [-@setala1970: 77]. Both show the same analysis, the only difference is the placement of the words. The upper version is very similar to Beckman's approach.
:::

For complex sentences with subordinate clauses, Setälä, Nieminen & Ojajärvi [-@setala1970: 97-98, 104-105] use a variant of the musical-score approach. Main clauses (*päälause*) are placed on top and subordinate clauses (*sivulause*) are graphically lowered depending on the depth of embedding. The example in [@next] is graphically analysed in [@fig:setälä1970_98].

::: ex
|
| Jos auta-t minu-a, kun tarvit-sen apu-a, anna-n sinu-lle tämä-n.
| if help-2SG me-PAR when need-1SG help-PAR give-1SG you-ALL this-GEN
| If you help me, when I need help, I will give you this.
