### Nägelsbach (1846) *Lateinische Stilistik* {#sec:nägelsbach1846}

Carl Friedrich Nägelsbach (1806-1859) was professor for classical studies in Erlangen. He wrote various commentaries on classical texts and a didactic explanation of Latin style, called *Lateinische Stilistik für Deutsche, ein sprachvergleichender Versuch* [@nagelsbach1846]. The book saw various editions up to a ninth edition in 1905, prepared by Iwan Müller. This ninth edition has been reprinted up to at least 1980.

In the *Lateinische Stilistik* Nägelsbach uses *Periodenbilder* to analyse latin constructions, citing both Lehmann [@nagelsbach1846: 281] and Götzinger [@nagelsbach1846: 282] as inspiration. He simplifies the structure of the *Periodenbild* to be able to write them on a single line, using slashes instead of horizontal braces, as illustrated in [@fig:nägelsbach1846_286] [@nagelsbach1846: 286].

Another innovation proposed by Nägelsbach is to use brackets for relative modification at the front of the sentence. Specifically, he notes that in Latin it is quite common to have multiple *Vordersätze*, i.e. clauses in front of the main clause, as indicated by the colon in Lehmann's notation. Because of the ordering of modification, Nägelsbach proposed *Periodenbilder* like "a:(b:A)" and even "a:(b:[c:A])" for reverse-nested frontal clauses [@nagelsbach1846: 286, 289].

::: {.im #nägelsbach1846_286}
Simplified *Periodenbild* from Nägelsbach [-@nagelsbach1846: 286]. To be able to write *Periodenbilder* as a single line, he replaces the horizontal brace from Lehmann and Götzinger with a simple forward slash. This makes them much easier to typeset.

### Menge (1873) *Repetitorium der lateinischen Syntax* {#sec:menge1873}

Hermann August Menge (1841-1939) was a teacher and is widely known as the translator of the infamous German *Menge-Bibel*. Based on his practical experience as a teacher he wrote textbooks for Latin and Greek. The Latin textbook was still in use far into the 20th Century, though in a slightly revised version [e.g. a 1955 edition is cited in @langholf1969: 10]. I will use here the sixth edition, which is the earliest edition I have been able to access [@menge1890]. The prefaces to the earlier editions do not mention any changes as far as the graphical analysis is concerned, so I assume that they were already present in the first edition of 1873.

Menge [-@menge1890: 357-364] uses a graphical analysis of the *Periode* in the tradition of Lehmann (see [@sec:lehmann1833]). However, he uses a forward slash instead of a horizontal brace, just like Nägelsbach (see [@sec:nägelsbach1846]). In the preface to the first edition Menge cites the influence of many different grammars of Latin [@menge1890: v], but not Nägelsbach. However, Nägelsbach is mentioned in passing at various times throughout the book [e.g. @menge1890: v, 342]. So it seems very likely that the use of the forward slashes is inspired by Nägelsbach.

In this example he presents various ways in which a subordinate clause can be positionen in Latin, nicely summarising the syntactic possibilities by using the different abbreviations. Menge here uses the forward slash for clause-final subordination, like Nägelsbach (see [@fig:nägelsbach1846_286]).

### Schulze (1883) *Adiumenta Latinitatis* {#sec:schulze1883}

Ernst Hendrik Ferdinand Schulze (1842-1911) was a teacher and school director, first in St. Petersburg and later in Bad Homburg vor der Höhe. Biographical details are available in Schulze [-@schulze1901: 46-47].^[A good overview is also available on <https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst_Schulze_(Historiker)>, accessed 7 January 2025.] He wrote an advanced Latin textbook *Adiumenta Latinitatis. Grundzüge des lateinischen Stils in Verbindung mit Übersetzungsstücken für die oberste Stufe des Gymnasiums* [@schulze1883].

In this book he used very simple *Periodenbilder* for the analysis of Latin sentences [@schulze1883: 116-122]. He only uses the letters *A* for main clause, *a* for subordinate clause, and *α* for secondary subordinate clause. Specifcally, he used this graphical analysis to explain differences between German and Latin sentence structure.  The regular Latin word order would be *a α A*, as shown in [@next]. However, the Latin word order is quite flexible, and many different orders are possible. Schulze then gives the table shown in [@fig:schulze1883_121] with the orders that are possible in Latin, but not in German.

### Gloël (1895) *Schriftliche Übersetzung aus dem Griechischen* {#sec:gloël1895}

Heinrich Gloël (1855-1940) was a teacher and literary scholar, first in Wesel and and later in Wetzlar. He started as a classical scholar, writing a disseration about the Greek play *Hippolytos* by Eurypides and teaching classical languages. Later in life he specialized in critical evaluations of texts of Goeths [more biographical information in @flender1983].

In an article about the role of translation from Greek to German in secondary education, Gloël discussed various examples from classical Greek and the problems with their translation into German [@gloel1895]. The final example he discusses is an excerpt from Plato's *Crito* [@gloel1895: 67-76]. For two complex sentences with many subordinated clauses in this excerpt, Gloël uses *Satzbilder* to illustrate their syntactic structure. For example, the *Satzbild* in [@fig:gloël1895_75] is an analysis of the sentence in [@next a]. I have added the letters from Gloël's *Satzbild* into this example, something which Gloël assumes that the reader is able to do. The translation in [@next b] is by Harald Fowler.^[Plato in Twelve Volumes, Vol. 1 translated by Harold North Fowler; Introduction by W.R.M. Lamb.

Capital letters are main clauses, lower-case Latin letters are subordinated clauses, greek letters are second-grade subordination. The letter "~~P~~" indicates a non-finite clause using a participles. Numbers indicate conjoined clauses to the previous letter-marked clause. The marker *B* for the second main clause should probably by placed on the same level as the main clause *A*. This appears to be a printing error.

### Broberg (1882) *Manuel de la langue danoise* {#sec:broberg1882}

*Severin* Carl Olfert Fischer Broberg (1822-1900) was a danish author and occasional lecturer at the Universities of Randers and Odense. He wrote a Danish language guide for French speakers, called *Manuel de la langue danoise* [@broberg1882]. To explain the Danish sentence structure he used a special graphical technique of an indented table [@broberg1882: 95-102]. There is no indication towards any inspiration that might have led Broberg to propose this kind of analysis.

Repeated here is one of Broberg's Danish example sentence in [@next a], with his own French translation [@next b]. An glossed version with English translation is added in [@next c]. Broberg's graphical analysis is shown in [@fig:broberg1882_95]. The basic sentence *Datter viste et Maleri* 'Daughter showed a painting' is shown in bold typeface at the left side of the tabular display. All modifier phrases are shown below their head phrases, indented to the right. The order of the phrases from top to bottom reflects their modification order. For example, *Datter* 'daughter' is first modified by *ældste* 'oldest' and then by *Generalens* 'of the general'. However, the order of these elements in a Danish sentence is reversed: the real order in which the words occur in the Danish sentence is indicated by the numbers in the table.

::: ex

### Jespersen (1921) *De to hovedarter av grammattiske forbindelser* {#sec:jespersen1921}

Otto Jespersen (1860-1943) was professor of English at Copenhagen. Jespersen worked on a wide variety of linguistic topics and throughout his long life he prepared a massive 7-volume *Modern English grammar on historical principles*. For most of his career he did not apply graphical or algebraic methods to linguistic analysis. There are just a few incidental symbolic representation in *Sprogets logik* 'The logic of language' [@jespersen1913: 80-81] and a single graphical representation in *De to hovedarter av grammattiske forbindelser* 'The two main types of grammatical connections' [@jespersen1921: 18]. Only towards the end of his life he published *Analytic syntax* [@jespersen1937], in which he laid out a completely symbolic framework for linguistic analysis. It feels like an idea he probably had been working on for a long time, but only published late in his career.

Jespersen proposed various structural principles for linguistic analysis, above all his notion of *rang* 'rank' [first introduced in @jespersen1913: 31]. The basic idea of *rang* is that there are different levels of modification in language. Jespersen uses roman capital letters *I, II, III* for these levels. He named the first three levels as *overled*, *adled* and *underled* [@jespersen1913: 31] or in a different publication *primær*, *sekundær* and *tertiær* [@jespersen1921: 3] and in English *principal*, *adjunct* and *subjunct* [@jespersen1913: 31]. He clearly intends there to be more levels, but he claims without much argumentation that further levels are inherently the same as the third level [@jespersen1921: 3]. 

Jespersen considers the first two levels to be the most interesting: *Da de tertiære elementer ikke gir anledning til videre bemærkninger, skal jeg nu helt forlade dem for at holde mig til forbindelserne mellem primære og sekundære elementer* 'Since the tertiary elements do not warrant further comment, I must now leave them entirely in order to stick to the connections between primary and secondary elements' [@jespersen1921: 4]. Jespersen goes into great detail about the many different ways level I and II occur in language. Curiously, he quickly stops using the letter I and II and changes to *P* and *S* instead. These letters are reminiscent of the terms "predicate" and "subject", though Jespersen does not want to use these terms:

> den består av to led, som vi for at undgå forvexlinger ikke tør kalde subjekt og prædikat, men foreløbig betegner ved bogstaverne S og P. [@jespersen1921: 7]
> 
> ('it consists of two parts, which, to avoid confusion, we dare not call subject and predicate, but for the time being denoted by the letters S and P.')

The abstract use of the letters *S* and *P* is probably an influence from Wundt (see [@sec:wundt1880]) and Sheffield (see [@sec:sheffield1912]). Jespersen cites both these authors at various places throughout his work, although not directly in connection to the abbreviations *S* and *P*. The impression arises that Jespersen had better used different terms like "dependent" and "head", but was stuck in the Wundtian tradition.

The only graphical analysis that I have been able to find in Jespersen's work also points to an influence from Wundt. Jespersen uses the letters *S* and *P* recursively, similar to Wundt, in a footnote citing an incomplete quotation from Quintus Curtius Rufus' *Historiae Alexandri Magni* [@next]. He then explains that *vi det ejendommelige at S i den ene nexus selv er en nexus* 'we have the peculiarity that S in one nexus is itself a nexus' [@jespersen1921: 18]. The subsequent graphical represenation of this analysis is shown in [@fig:jespersen1921_18].

:::

At the end of his long life Jespersen published the book *Analytic syntax* [@jespersen1937], in which he laid out a completely symbolic framework for linguistic analysis, leaving the simplistic *S/P* approach behind.. The approach in *Analytic syntax* is algebraic, using symbols and brackets to analyse linguistic utterances. He does not draw any graphical representations, although Francis [-@francis1989: 83] shows that is clearly possible to interpret the bracketing as a constituent tree. Also, Jespersen [-@jespersen1937: 83] includes a graphical syntactic analysis in his book, citing Fry (see [@sec:fry1925]), so he was clearly aware of the possibility to use images to analyse language. However, for some reason Jespersen preferred an algebraical approach, citing Stöhr (see [@sec:stöhr1898]), Sapir (see [@sec:sapir1921]), Bologne (see [@sec:bologne1935]) and Brøndal (see [@sec:brøndal1932]) as having similar approaches.

Jespersen uses letters, superscripts and brackets to represent syntactic structure, and, being the detailed grammarian that he has been for his whole life, he presents many pages with hundreds of examples of this system for a plethora of different grammatical phenomena from a dozen different languages [@jespersen1937: 6-84]. This is hands-down the most well-documented system of all approaches discussed in this book. A more in-depth discussion of Jespersen's approach can be found in Francis [-@francis1989] and Cigana [-@cigana2020]. As an illustration of his approach an example is shown here in [@fig:jespersen1937_83] for an example sentence taken from Fry [-@fry1925: 64].

The brackets are not consistently closed in this example, but that appears to be a printing error (there should have been a closing bracket below *knife* and below *feeding*). All other examples in his book that I have checked have properly closed brackets.

### Hjelmslev (1928) *Principes de grammaire générale*

Louis Trolle Hjelmslev (1899-1965) was a linguist at the university of Copenhagen and co-founder of the *Lingvistkredsen* 'Linguistic Circle of Copenhagen' with Brøndal (see [@sec:brøndal1932]). Hjelmslev developed an intricate system of linguistic analysis under the label *glossomatik*, but he does not appear to have applied this to the analysis of longer stretches of text. There are many graphics in his work, but they mostly deal with paradigmatic structures. A rare syntactic visualisation is the rather trivial example shown in [@fig:hjelmslev1928_138] [@hjelmslev1928: 138] for the Latin sentence in [@next a]. A few years later he adds another trivial visualisation, as shown in [@fig:hjelmslev1935_52] [@hjelmslev1935: 52] for the Latin example in [@next b]. These visualisations are probably better analysed as showing government/agreement relations, and not as a real syntactic sentence analysis.

### Brøndal (1932) *Morfologi og syntax* {#sec:brøndal1932}

Rasmus *Viggo* Brøndal (1887-1942) was a professor at Copenhagen and a co-founder of the *Lingvistkredsen* 'Linguistic Circle of Copenhagen' [biographical information is available in @hallon1989: xvi-xxvi]. In his books *Ordklasserne: partes orationis. Studier over de sproglige kategorier* [@brondal1928] and more specifically in *Morfologi og syntax* [@brondal1932; translated in @hallon1989] Brøndal develops a highly idiosyncratic system for linguistic analysis based on symbolic combinations of the letters *D, d, R, r*, as summarised in the fold-out appendix to the *Ordklasserne* [@brondal1928], shown here in [@fig:brøndal1928_appendix].

::: {.im #brøndal1928_appendix}
[@brondal1928]
:::

In his books, Brøndal applies combinations of these letters (extended with colons and italic typesetting) for all kinds of different linguistic phenomena. Unfortunately, his examples for the application of this system to actual linguistic data are very short and difficult to interpret. For example, there are no real analyses of longer sentences in the discussion about syntax [@brondal1932: Chapter 2]. Togeby [-@togeby1989] proposes an interpretation of Brøndal ideas in more modern terms and visualisations. Specifically, he argues that Brøndal actually describes a hierarchichal constituency structure for sentences as shown in [@fig:togeby1989_109] for the example in [@next a]. For the internal structure of noun phrases, Brøndal [-@brondal1932: §70] uses roman numerals I through VI, which Togeby [-@togeby1989: 110] interprets as a templatic structure, shown in [@fig:togeby1989_110] for the examples in [@next b]. Such a templatic structure only becomes mainstream with the work of Diderichsen (see [@sec:diderichsen1947]).

However, Togeby's interpretation is consistent with the examples as discussed by Brøndal.

### Hansen (1933) *Sætningen og dens led in moderne dansk* {#sec:hansen1933}

Aage Hansen (1894-1983) studied with Otto Jespersen in Copenhagen and worked at that university for the rest of his career. He was a central author in the preparation of two major encyclopaedic works about the Danish language, namely the dictionary *Ordbog over det danske Sprog* and the grammar *Moderne Dansk* [more biographical information in @hjorth2025]. Earlier in his career Hansen wrote a rather programmatic book about language analysis, called *Sætningen og dens led in moderne dansk* 'sentences and its parts in modern danish' [@hansen1933]. This book is dedicated to Jespersen and contains various graphical analyses. However, the graphics do not play a central role in his argumentation and are only used sporadically as illustrations. 

Hansen uses examples from danish literature throughout his book, and he is particularly precise in referencing these examples. The examples in [@next], used for the graphics shown below, are from the author Karl Larsen. In contrast, Hansen does not cite much scientific literature, so it remains unclear how his diagrams originated. However, he regularly mentions his teacher Jesperson, who cites [e.g. in @jespersen1913] the work of Sheffield (see [@sec:sheffield1912]) and Wundt (see [@sec:wundt1880]). So the diagrams of Hansen are probably related to the immediate constituent tradition developing in the USA at the time Hansen is writing this book. 

The whole book is centered around the assumption that a sentence consists of two parts, which Hansen called the *A-led* 'part A' and *B-led* 'part B' [@hansen1933: 23]. He explicitly explains that this division is not equivalent to the subject/predicate devision, but more alike to a topic/comment opposition or the classical onoma/rhema distinction [@hansen1933: 69].

> en meddelelse består af to nødvendige elementer: en angivelse af den størrelse, man vil meddele noget om, og en angivelse af selve det, man
vil meddele om denne størrelse. [@hansen1933: 22]
>
> ('A message consists of two necessary elements: a statement of the quantity you want to communicate, and a statement of what you want to communicate about this quantity.')

The graphical illustrations in his book only deal with the internal structure of the part B, although this might be a coincidence due to the sparse usage of the illustrations. Hansen uses three different graphical approaches, all intended to illustrate hierarchical modification of constituents. The first approach is a "chinese boxes" or "Matryoshka dolls" visualisation in which modifiers are hierachically organised by drawing enclosing circles or boxes. One of his drawings is shown here in [@fig:hansen1933_93a] for a small part of the example [@next a]. Hansen's second approach is particularly innovative, and I have not seen anything like this before or since. As shown in [@fig:hansen1933_93b] Hansen draws a *Planetskemaet* 'planetary scheme', in which a modifier is metaphorically compared to a planet or moon circling around another celectial body. 

Finally, he also uses a more 'regular' visualisation using hierarchically ordered brackets, with a Roman numeral I for the modified element and a Roman numeral II for the modifier. This approach is shown in [@fig:hansen1933_105] for part of the sentence [@next b]. The use of Roman numerals is probably taken from Jespersen's *rang* notation [@jespersen1913: 31]. The hierarchical brackets are also found in Jespersen's work (see [@sec:jespersen1921]), but Jespersen never seems to have applied this visualisation as consistently as Hansen does here (see [@sec:jespersen1921]).

### Lindwall (1903) *Några ord om satsanalys* {#sec:lindwall1903}

Anshelm Fredrik Wilhelm Lindwall (1859-1931) was a teacher in Stockholm.^[Some biographical information is available on the swedish Wikipedia <https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_Lindwall>, accessed 11 January 2025.] In 1903 he writes a short paper with the title *Några ord om satsanalys* 'a few words about sentence analysis' [@lindwall1903]. This paper starts out as a review of a grammatical textbook by Rebbe & Fischer, but in the second part of this review Lindwall proposes a graphical display for the exaplanation of syntax *med tillhjälp af svarta taflan* 'with the help of the blackboard' [@lindwall1903: 137]. There is no indication given by Lindwall about the inspiration for his drawings.

Lindwall uses two different visualisation, one for the internal structure of single-clause sentences and another one for the structure of multi-clause sentences. His single-clause analysis is illustrated here with [@fig:lindwall1903_138] for the example in [@next a]. The predicate is depicted as a double horizontal line, while the subject is a vertical line upwards, the object a vertical line downwards and prepositional phrases are shown as the diagonal line downwards. Adverbials are crosses on the line, adjectives are diagonal slashes through the line (not shown in this example).

For multi-clause sentences, each clause is depicted by a line, as shown here in [@fig:lindwall1903_146] for the example in [@next b]. In these graphics, all lines are drawn in the same order as they occur in the sentence. Main clauses are horizontal lines, while subordinate clauses are vertical lines. Secondary embedded subordination is indicated by diagonal lines. So, the example in [@fig:lindwall1903_146] has a main clause (horizontal: *jag hoppas*), a subordinate clause (vertical: *att du kommer*), then a secondary subordinate clause (slanted down rightwards: *när du slutat arbetet*) and finally even a tertiary subordinate clause (slanted down leftwards: *hvarmed du varit sysselsatt*). Lindwall proposes a few more techniques (not shown here), e.g. a plus-symbol for coordination and dashed lines for non-finite clauses.

::: ex
a.
| 
| Man-nen gaf genast en slant ât den fattige.
| man-DEF gave immediately a coin to the poor
| The man immediately gave a coin to the beggar.
b.
|
| jag hoppas, att du kommer, när du slutat arbetet, hvarmed du varit sysselsatt.
| I hope that you come when you stop work with.which you are busy
| I hope you will come when you have finished the work with which you were busy.
:::

::: {.im #lindwall1903_138}
Single-clause sentence [@last a] in the analysis of Lindwall [-@lindwall1903: 138]. The predicate is indicated by the double horizontal line and departing from this each line is a constituent of the clause (subject upwards, object downwards, prepositional phrases diagonally downwards). Modifiers are graphicall represented on the lines (adverbials with a cross, adjectives with a dash).
:::

::: {.im #lindwall1903_146}
Multi-clause sentence [@last b] in the analysis of Lindwall [-@lindwall1903: 146]. Each line represents a clause in the order as they occur in the sentence. Main clause are shown horizontally, primary subordinate clauses vertically. Any subsequent subordination is shown by a diagonal line, alternating in direction.

### Beckman (1904) *Svensk Språklära* {#sec:beckman1904}

Karl Frederik *Natanael* Beckman (1868-1946) was a high school teacher and later professor of Scandinavian languages at Gothenburg University [more biographical details are available in @friesen1922]. He wrote many different analyses of Swedish, both synchronically and diachronically. His *Svensk språklära för den högre elementarundervisningen* [@beckman1904] has been widely used and has remained in print at least until a 9th edition in the 1960s. He also prepared two reduced versions of this work, namely the *Svensk språklära för elementarundervisningen* [@beckman1908] and the *Svensk språklära för folkskolan* [@beckman1912]. These do not seem to add anything new and will not be further discussed here. 

Beckman [-@beckman1904: 273] cites Kern (see [@sec:kern1883]) and Lindwall (see [@sec:lindwall1903]) as inspiration for his graphical display, which he calls a *karta* 'map'. He uses a balanced display with subject and object at the top linked by a line [@beckman1904: 194-198, 202, 219], explicitly distancing his approach from Kern's verb-centric display [@beckman1904: 273]. An example for a single-clause sentence is shown in [@fig:beckman1904_194] for the sentence in [@next a]. This figure is actually a compositive from parts that are explained separately by Beckman. However, Beckman invites the reader to produce this combined picture, to which I have happily obliged: *Du kan nu själf rita en karta öfver hela satsen* 'You can now draw a map of the entire sentence yourself' [@beckman1904: 195].

Dependencies are linked by upwards-pointing arrows. Multiple dependencies to the same head are indicated by horizontal brackets. Somewhat confusingly, sometimes the arrows are missing, as with *fädernesland* 'homeland' and *från välde* 'from the reign' in [@fig:beckman1904_194]. It is unclear whether this is an error, or whether Beckman intended to omit the arrows for arguments. For multi-clause sentences Beckman simply draws separate figures for each clause, and indicates with the word *bisatz* 'subordinate clause' where the subordinate clause has to be inserted into the matrix clause. An example of a multi-clause sentence in shown in [@fig:beckman1904_202] for the example in [@next b].

::: ex
a.
| 
| Vår store och ädle konung Gustaf Vasa har befriat vårt gamla fädernesland från danskarnas tryckande välde.

### Noreen (1906) *Vårt språk*

Adolf Gotthard Noreen (1854-1925) was a professor for Germanic languages at Uppsala University [More biographical information in @elmevik1990]. His work was of great influence on all of scandinavian linguistics, but he does not seem to have used graphical analyses for sentence structure. However, he used an interesting graphical approach to morphological structure in the 7th volume of his magnum opus *Vårt språk* [@noreen1906].

Noreen uses dashes to separate morphemes, but additionally the number of dashes is crucial for the hierarchical morphological structure. The more dashes, the more distant the morphological connection: *jag låter den primära sammansättningens leder skiljas af ett bindestreck, den sekundäras af två osv.* 'I separate the primary compounds by a hyphen, the secondary by two, etc.' [@noreen1906: 32-33]. Two of his examples are shown in [@next] and a modern rendition of the intended hierarchical structure is displayed in [@fig:noreen1906_33tree].

### Rebbe (1935) *Svensk språklära för realskolan*

Carl Rebbe (1862-1948) was a teacher in Gothenburg [some basic biographical information is available in @sjogren1949]. In 1912 he wrote the *Svensk språklära för realskolan* 'Swedish language-teaching for middle school'. This book has been extremely popular and remained in print in various editions and revisions until the 1970s, revised by either Nils Ivan, Helge Gullberg and/or Birger Bjerre. I have only been able to access the tenth edition from 1935 [@rebbe1935]. Starting in 1917 Rebbe also prepared a frequently reprinted *kortfattad* 'concise' version of the *Svensk språklära*. And in 1902 he published a collection of examples called *Exempelsamling till inöfvande af allmänna satsläran och skiljetecknens bruk* 'Collection of examples for practicing general syntax and the use of punctuation marks'. Walter Fischer revised this collection in 1914 with a minor change in title (*svenska satsläran* instead of *allmänna satsläran*). All these different textbooks and their numerous editions need a more in-depth investigation and comparison.

In the 1935 version, there is a single page with various examples of the graphical analysis of single-clause sentences [@rebbe1935: 188]. An example is shown in [@fig:rebbe1935_118] for the example in [@next]. The pointing arrows are clearly similar to the approach from Beckman (see [@sec:beckman1904]). The other examples also show various details that indicate that this visual display was inspired by Beckman (e.g. adverbials pointing to the line connecting subject and predicate).

::: ex
| Swedish [@rebbe1935: 188]

### Setälä & Nieminen (1939) *Suomen kielen oppikirja*

Eemil Nestor Setälä (1864-1935) was a well-known Finnish politician and author of the Finnish declaration of independence.^[I thank Fred Karlsson and Matti Miestamo for their assistance with the Finnisch language and linguistic tradition.] However, he was also a professor for Finnish language and literature at Helsinki University and among many other grammatical works he wrote a little booklet *Suomen kielen oppikirja* 'Finnisch language textbook'. The first edition appeared in 1898 and has been reprinted various time. The version from 1925, that I have consulted, does not have any graphical analyses [@setala1925].

Kaarlo Nieminen (1887-1955) was a Finnish language teacher and acting professor of Finnish literature at Helsinki University for a few years. After the death of Setälä he revised the *Suomen kielen oppikirja* in 1939, which was reprinted many times. In this revision Nieminen added a graphical analysis for the example sentence in [@next] as shown in [@fig:setälä1946_68], cited here from a later reprint [@setala1946: 68]. It is unclear whether this approach with arrows for modification has any precursors, or whether this is an original idea from Nieminen:

> Lauseenosien keskinäisiä suhteita voidaan havainnollistaa piirroksen avulla. Jos merkitsemme subjektin paksulla pystysuoralla viivalla, predikaatin siitä lähtevällä paksulla vaakasuoralla viivalla, kumpaisenkin määräykset niihin vinosti suuntautuvilla ohuemmilla viivoilla sekä määräysten määräykset taas niihin suuntautuvilla viivoilla. [@setala1946: 68]
> 
> ('The mutual relations of the parts of a sentence can be illustrated by means of a drawing. If we mark the subject with a thick vertical line, the predicate with a thick horizontal line extending from it, the modifiers of each with thinner lines directed at them diagonally, and the modifiers of the modifiers again with lines directed at them.')

::: ex

| Mattila-n pienet pojat luke-vat hyvin ahkerasti vaikeita läksyjä-nsä

The diagonal placement of the arrows is also faintly reminiscent of the USA-style diagramming, but the details of the positioning are completely different. This display might very well be an innovation by Nieminen.

Aulis Onni Ojajärvi (1913-1968) was a dialectologist and language teacher.^[Some biographical information is available online at <http://www.norssit.fi/sivut/5_5_norssin_ojajarvi.php>, accessed 13 January 2025.] In 1964, after the death of Kaarlo Nieminen, he once again revised the *Suomen kielen oppikirja*. The version from 1970, that I have consulted, is rather different from earlier versions and contains completely different graphical analyses [@setala1970]. The structure from the examples sentence [@next] is illustrated in two different ways in [@fig:setälä1970_77]. The upper version is strongly reminiscent of the visualisation of Beckman (see [@sec:beckman1904]). The lower display is structurally identical, but the words are placed in their regular sentence order.

::: ex
|
| Juuri kaupungi-sta saapunut setä anto-i minu-lle pussi-n makeis-i-a.

:::

For complex sentences with subordinate clauses, Setälä, Nieminen & Ojajärvi [-@setala1970: 97-98, 104-105] use a variant of the musical-score approach. Main clauses (*päälause*) are placed on top and subordinate clauses (*sivulause*) are graphically lowered depending on the depth of embedding. The example in [@next] is graphically analysed in [@fig:setälä1970_98].

::: ex
|
| Jos auta-t minu-a, kun tarvit-sen apu-a, anna-n sinu-lle tämä-n.

## Hungarian

### Lonkay (1855) *Gyakorlati Német Nyelvtan* {#sec:lonkay1855}

Antal Lonkay (1827-1888) was a teacher in Pest, Hungary [some biographical information is available in @benda1971]. He wrote a German grammar for speakers of Hungarian, called *Gyakorlati Nemet Nyelvtan az ausztriai birodalombeli elemi tanodak masodik es harmadik osztalyainak szamara* 'Practical German grammar for the second and third grades of elementary school students in the Austrian Empire' [@lonkay1855]. 

In this grammar Lonkay used a templatic table for German sentence structure [see @good2016 for the linguistic notion of a template]. Most interestingly, Lonkay distinguishes specific positions for the finite verb at the second position and for non-finite parts at the end. The table is shown here in [@fig:lonkay1855_175] [@lonkay1855: 175]. This syntactic analysis is very similar to what today in German grammar is called a "topological model", which is commonly attributed to Drach (1937, see [@sec:drach1937]) and/or Diderichsen (1946, see [@sec:diderichsen1947]). However, as shown by this example from Lonkay, this approach is much older, possibly even dating back to Becker (1830, see [@sec:becker1830]). There is no indication in the book for any inspiration that Lonkay might have had for this approach.

The first position in this table is called *alany* 'subject' and the rest *allitmány* 'predicate'. Lonkay also explicitly discusses examples with non-subjects in first position on the next page as deviating from the structure shown in this table. The section called 'predicate' is separated into the following columns:

- *Ige vagy esak segédige* 'Verb or auxiliary verb'
- *Idöt*  'Time'
- *Helyet* 'Place'
- *Ohot* 'Reason'
- *Módot* 'Manner'
- *Kiegészitö nevek különféle esetekben elöljárók nélkül* 'Proper nouns in various cases without prepositions'
- *Igenév v. határtalan mod és az igének hátratett elöljárók* 'Participle or non-finite mode and prepositions placed behind the verb'

Lonkay explains in a bit more detail which elements are placed in this final position, which today is commonly called the *Rechte Satzklammer* 'rightmost sentence bracket'. This proposal to combine non-finite verbs together with separable preverbs ('prepositions') into a single slot at the end of a sentence is, for example, not yet found in Drach [-@drach1937].

> … végre az igenév vagy a határtalan mód, vagy bezárhatja még a mondatot az igének elülröl elszakított s hátratett elöljárója. [@lonkay1855: 175]
>
> ('… finally the participle or indefinite mood, or the sentence may be closed by the preposition of the verb that has been separated from the front and placed behind.')

::: {.im #lonkay1855_175}
Templatic table for German sentence structure from Lonkay [-@lonkay1855: 175]. The *allitmány* 'predicate' starts with a slot *Ige vagy esak segédige* 'Verb or auxiliary verb' and ends with a slot *Igenév v. határtalan mod és az igének hátratett elöljárók* 'Participle or non-finite mode and prepositions placed behind the verb'. This is very similar to the contemporary German grammatical sentence analysis using a *Verbalklammer* "sentence bracket".

### Brassai (1873) *Paraleipomena kai diorthoumena* {#sec:brassai1873}

Sámuel Brassai (1800-1897) was a polymath in the Austro-Hungarian empire, who worked most of his life at the university of Klausenburg (today Cluj, Rumania). He published in Hungarian about a wide variety of subjects, including linguistics [more details about his linguistic work in @imrenyi2020a].

Of particular interest is his *Paraleipomena kai diorthoumena. A mit nem mondtak s a mit roszul mondtak a commentatorok Virg. Aeneise II. könyvére* 'Omissions and corrections: What was not said and what was wrongly said by the commentators on Book II of Virgil's Aeneid' [@brassai1873]. As the title clearly states, this book is a discussion of classical literature. The graphical analyses are inside a (long) footnote, explaining that adverbial modifiers can have different interpretations, depending on which word they modify. The graphical illustrations are thus only used as an aside, it is not the central topic of the discussion at all.

To exemplify the problem of adverbial modification, Brassai chooses a sentence rather randomly from classical literature, ending up with a sentence from Ovid, shown here in [@next a] with a poetic translation in [@next b]. Ovid's sentence structure is infamous for being particularly unwieldy. Out of context, the adverbial phrase *imbre per indignas usque cadente genas* 'a shower (of tears) falling on innocent cheeks' could either modify the verb *tenebat* 'she held him' ([@fig:brassai1873_7] I), the accusative *flentem* 'the weeping one' ([@fig:brassai1873_7] II) or the nominative *uxor flens* 'wife weeping' ([@fig:brassai1873_7] III). Brassai uses the images to explain the structural difference between these possibilities.

::: ex
- uxor amans flentem flens acrius ipsa tenebat imbre per indignas usque cadente genas. [@brassai1873: 7, citing Ovid *Tristia*]
- My loving wife was in my arms as I wept, herself weeping more bitterly, tears raining constantly over her innocent cheeks.^[Translation by A. L. Wheeler. Revised by G. P. Goold for the Loeb Classical Library. Available online at <https://www.loebclassics.com/view/ovid-tristia/1924/pb_LCL151.21.xml>.]
:::

::: {.im #brassai1873_7}
*Schemaja* from Brassai [-@brassai1873: 7-8] of the examples sentence in [@last a]. With these graphics, Brassai explains that the adverbial phrase *imbre per indignas usque cadente genas* 'a shower (of tears) falling on innocent cheeks' could be interpreted in different ways, modifying different elements of the sentence. The Latin structure does not tell which is the right interpretation, it has to be decided from context.
:::

Brassai uses a similar graphic later in his book [@brassai1873: 37], also in a footnote. There he calls his graphic a *schemaja*. It is unclear where the inspiration for this graphical display originates. Imrényi & Vladár [-@imrenyi2020a: 166-169] propose that it is Brassai's own interpretation of Priscian, with possibly an influence from Billroth (cf. [@sec:billroth1832]). Particularly noteworthy is the verb-centric display, which is not previously attested. Brassai appears to be the first to use such an analysis. The next author to use rather similar looking graphical displays is Kern (cf. [@sec:kern1883]), but there is no evidence that Kern knew about Brassai's graphical analysis.

### Buslaev (1844) *О преподавании отечественного языка*

Fedor Ivanovich Buslaev (1818-1897) was professor for Russian linguistics in Moscow.^[Some basic biographical information is available on Wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fyodor_Buslaev>, accessed 20 February 2025.] He was strongly influenced by the German linguistic tradition and cites broadly throughout the German literature. Although he does not explicity cite any influence for his graphical approach, he might have been inspired by Diesterweg (see [@sec:diesterweg1830]) and Mager (see [@sec:mager1840]), both of which are cited recurrently by Buslaev.

In his book *О преподавании отечественного языка* ('On the teaching of the native language') he discusses the analysis of large sentences with multiple subordinate clauses [@buslaev1844: 260]. As an example he give an analysis of a fable [@next] by using a graphical structure with large horizontal braces, as shown in [@fig:buslaev1844_260]. The original structure of this sentence has a lot of clausal centre-embedding. This is indicated in the graphical analysis by the braces, indicating the insertion point of the subordinate clause.

### Lugebil (1883) *Синтаксись Аполлонія Даскола* {#sec:lugebil1883}

Karl Yakimovich Lugebil (1830-1887) was a classical scholar, teacher and from 1864 professor in St. Petersburg.^[Some basic biographical information is available online at <https://www.biografija.ru/biography/ljugebil-karl-yakimovich.htm>, accessed 22 February 2025.] In a review of a book by Anton Dobiasz about the *Syntax* of Apollonius Dyscolus he uses various graphical syntactic analyses [@lugebil1883: 127-128]. In his review, Lugebil mostly cites German grammatical literature, for example there is a long discussion about the merits of Becker's grammatical ideas (cf. [@sec:becker1829]). Later, in a discussion about different interpretations of copula constructions, Lugebil cites Lehmann (see [@sec:lehmann1833]) and Nägelsbach (see [@sec:nägelsbach1846]) as important proponents of the idea to use graphical representations to explain grammatical structure:

> По этому поводу обращаю вниманіе гг. преподавателей на то, какь важнодля нагляднаго объясненія-прибегать кь графическому изображенію какь отношеній различныхь составныхь частей предложенія другь кь другу, такь и отношеній подчиненія ихь другь другу или сочетанія различныхь предложеній, входящихь вь составь періодовь античной речи. [@lugebil1883: 128, fn. 1]
> 
> ('In this regard, I would like to draw the attention of Messrs. teachers to the importance of resorting to a graphic representation for a visual explanation of both the relationships of the various constituent parts of a sentence to each other, as well as the subordinate relationships to each other or the combination of various sentences that make up a period in classical language.')

Lugebil uses a completely different graphical format from Lehmann and Nägelsbach, illustrated here in [@fig:lugebil1883_127]. Crucially, Lugebil uses a system of hierarchical bracketing, which does not appear at this point in time in the German tradition. Lugebil's graphics are used to illustrate two different interpretations of the Latin sentence [@next]. Although this sentence clearly means 'Cicero became consul in that year', Lugebil argues that there is an "older" *(прежній)* interpretation, roughly equivalent to 'Cicero is a consul, installed in that year'. This "older" interpretation is shown to the left in [@fig:lugebil1883_127], while the regular "newer" *(позднійшій)* interpretation is shown to the right.

In this "older" interpretation the sentence would be something like 'Cicero is a consul, installed in that year'.

### Petrov (1906) *Русскій язык* {#sec:petrov1906}

Konstantin Fedorovich Petrov (1850-1914) wrote an introductory grammar of Russian, called *Русскій язык* 'Russian language' in 1880. The first volume, called *синтаксис* 'syntax', contains two dependency-like sentence analyses. Petrov also writes a second volume about morphology, called *этимологія* 'etymology', which will not be further discussed here.^[Various editions of the etymology volume are available online: the second edition from 1886 at <https://vivaldi.dspl.ru/bx0005310>, the 24th edition from 1913 at <https://rusneb.ru/catalog/000202_000006_2570896>, the 27th edtion from 1915 at <https://imwerden.de/publ-1047> and the 32nd edition from 1922 (revised by Ushakov after Petrov's death) at <https://www.prlib.ru/en/node/363128>.] These books were popular and appeared in at least 32 editions up to the end of the 1920s.

In the early editions of the syntax that I have been able to access there is no graphical grammar, neither in the second edition [@petrov1881] not in the eight edition [@petrov1898]. However, a graphical display is added around the turn of the century. Thümmel [-@thummel1993: 171] cites an example from the 12th edition of 1906 and apparently the same graphics (on exactly the same page number, viz. page 127) are also found in the 20th edition, as cited below [@petrov1912: 127]. Petrov adds the graphical analyses to his grammar without any explanation and as a separate page at the end of the book, quite detached from the rest of the grammar. I have not been able to find any indications about what compelled Petrov to add these graphics, nor whether there was any influence from other authors. Petrov uses vertical arrows, which is reminiscent of Beckman (see [@sec:beckman1904]). However, the details differ substantially between Beckman's and Petrov's approach, specifically the arrows are pointing in opposite directions.

Petrov's analysis of a single-clause sentence from Pushkin [@next] is shown in [@fig:petrov1912_127a]. This graphic has the subject *полоса* 'stripe' and predicate *объемлетъ* 'include' on top. The dependents are placed below linked by arrows. However, the two lower arrows are quite unusual, because they link the words at the bottom to the words in the middle, but that does not reflect the meaning of the sentence. To the left, the adjective *багряной* 'red' modifies *полоса* 'stripe' and not *зари* 'dawn'. Likewise to the right, the object *небеса* 'sky' should be linked directly to the predicate *объемлетъ* 'include' and not the the adverb *ярко* 'brightly'.

::: ex
| Russian [@petrov1912: 127, citing from a poem of Pushkin]
| Зари багряной полоса объемлетъ ярко небеса
| dawn red stripe include brightly sky
| The red stripe of dawn brightly embraces the sky.
:::

::: {.im #petrov1912_127a}
Analysis of a single-clause sentence [@last] from Petrov [-@petrov1912: 127]. It looks like a typical analysis found in the German literature around this time, with subject and predicate on top and dependents linked below. However, the subsequent linking of the words on the bottom seems to be wrong: they should be linked directly to the words on top and not to the words in the middle.
:::

Petrov also presents an analysis of a multi-clause sentence [@next] as shown in [@fig:petrov1912_127b]. This sentence is from a fable by Igor Dmitriev and it is shown in [@next] in the original clause order. Note that, strictly speaking, [@next b,d] are phrases, not clauses. In this analysis Petrov uses the arrows to show the relationship between the different clauses, like in a *Periodenbild* in the German tradition. The positioning of the arrows quite deliberately appears to start at the exact word that governs the subordinate element.

::: ex
a.
| (linked to *бѣжать* 'run' in (c) as *когда?* 'when' )
| Оставя нашу нору и перебравшись черезъ гору,
| leave our hole and move across mountain
| Leaving our hole and crossing the mountain,
b.
| (linked to *гору* 'mountain' in (a) as *прилож(еніе)* 'apposition')
| границу нашихъ странъ, 
| boundary our country
| the border of our country,
c.
| (main clause on top)
| пустился я бѣжать,

| like a young mouse,
e.
| (linked to *мышенокъ* 'mouse' in (d) as *какой?* 'which')
| который хочеть показать, 
| who want show
| who wants to show
f.
| (linked to *показать* 'show' in (e) as *что?* 'what')
| что онъ ужъ не ребенокъ.
| what he really not child
| that he is no longer a child.
:::

::: {.im #petrov1912_127b}
Analysis of a multi-clause sentence [@last] from Petrov [@petrov1912: 127]. The arrows are positioned starting at the word that is modified by the subsequent clause. The left-right placement of the clauses suggests the actual order of the clauses in the sentence.
:::

After the death of Petrov the books are updated by Ušakov (see [@sec:ušakov1926]). He makes a few minor changes to the graphical display as well [@petrov1923: 167]. First, Ušakov updates the Russian orthography. More interestingly, he reverses one arrow in the analysis of the multi-clause sentence. The new display is shown in [@fig:petrov1923_167b]. Ušakov reverses the arrow to the first subordinate clause, viz. the arrow marked *когда?* 'when?' now points upwards. The effect of this change is that the arrows can now be read as indicating the order in which the elements occur in the original sentence. I also found a 32nd edition with apparently the same content, but a different page-layout, in which also an arrow in the first graphic from [@fig:petrov1912_127a] is changed [@petrov1923a: 115]. This change does not make any sense to me. 

::: {.im #petrov1923_167b}
The same analysis of [@last] as shown in [@fig:petrov1912_127b] from the grammar by Petrov in the revision by Ushakov [-@petrov1923: 167]. The graphic is basically the same, though Ušakov updated the Russian orthography and, curiously, he reversed the direction of the arrow for the inital subordinate clause (marked *когда?* 'when'). Instead of pointing to the dependents, the arrows now seem to indicate the ordering of the clauses in the original sentence.

### Zeltser & Vvedensky (1925) *Как самому изучать русский язык*

Sofya Afanasyevna Zeltser and Dmitry Nikolaevich Vvedensky wrote *Как самому изучать русский язык* 'How to learn Russian yourself' around 1925 [the second edition is @zeltser1925]. The book includes a single dependency-like tree for the sentence [@next] as shown in [@fig:zeltser1926_68]. As in many other such graphics, the subject-predicate pair is placed on top. However, different from all other approaches, the other elements are linked to this whole pair, not to the predicate alone. Also notewhorthy is the fact, that the words are not themselves interpreted as the the nodes in the graph, but placed along the edges.

### Barkhudarov (1938) *Грамматика русского языка*

Stepan Grigorievich Barkhudarov (1894-1983) was the head of the Leningrad Pedagogical Institute and lifelong active member of the USSR Academy of Sciences. A major aspect of his work was supervising the work on the 17-Volume *Словарь русского языка XVIII века* ('Dictionary of the Russian Language of the XVIII century'), which started appearing only after his death [more biographical details are presented by @ivanchikova1994]. All through his long career he wrote various textbooks about Russian grammar, which remain in use at least up to the 1970s. He also wrote various books about English grammar in Russian, and in this context Barkhudarov was intemately familiar with immediate constituents and the developing transformation generative grammar. For example Barkhudarov [-@barkhudarov1966] includes many syntactic trees in the style of Chomsky, though Chomsky himself is not cited. Barkhudarov seem most strongly influenced by Postal [-@postal1964a].

Much earlier, in 1938, Barkhudarov published the two-volume *Грамматика русского языка* ('Grammar of the Russian language'). The second volume deals with syntax and this book is cited here from the third edition [@barkhudarov1940]. There are various examples of dependency-style graphics in this book. The first *схемы* 'scheme' [from @barkhudarov1940: 7] is shown in [@fig:barkhudarov1940_7] for the sentence in [@next a]. In this scheme, subject and predicate are placed on top with the dependencies linked below. Note that the left/right-direction of the dependency-lines indicates the order of the dependents relative to its head: a line slanted down left indicates that the dependent comes before the head, while down right indicates that it comes after the head. This idea was introduced by Trunk (see [@sec:trunk1895]), but there is no indication that Barkhudarov knew about this work. The next graph [from @barkhudarov1940: 9] is shown in [@fig:barkhudarov1940_9] for the example in [@next b]. In this example he does not use this left/right-direction, but adds different kinds of connecting lines. These lines follow a basic tripartite syntactic distinction introducted by Barkhudarov [-@barkhudarov1940: 8]. He distinguishes:

- согласованием 'agreement' (double line)
- управлением 'government' (dotted line)
- примыканием 'adjacency' (single line)

Later in this book there are also example for NP-coordination [@barkhudarov1940: 42] and a few simple examples of multi-clause sentences [@barkhudarov1940: 115-118], which are not shown here.

*схемы* 'schema' for the example sentence in [@last a] from Barkhudarov [-@barkhudarov1940: 7]. The left/right-direction of the dependency lines indicates the placement of the dependent relative to its head: a line to the left indicates placement before, while a line to the right indicates placement after the head.

::: {.im #barkhudarov1940_9}
*схемы* 'schema' for the example sentence in [@last b] from Barkhudarov [-@barkhudarov1940: 9]. The different kind of dependency lines indicate different kinds of grammatical relationships: agreement (double line), government (dotted line) and adjacency (single line).

With various co-authors, Burkhudarov wrote many grammar textbooks for use in school which remained in print at least up to the 1970s [e.g. @barkhudarov1974]. There are still examples of a *схему разбора* 'parsing scheme' in these books, but in detail they look different again. The lines are replaced by arrows and syntactic functions of the words in the sentence are indicated by different kinds of underlining:

- подлежащее 'subject' (single line)
- сказуемое 'predicate' (double line)
- определение 'attribute' (wriggly line)
- дополнение 'complement' (dashed line)
- обстоятельство 'adverbial' (dot-dashed line)

::: ex
| Russian [@barkhudarov1974: 38, citing Sergey P. Antonov]
| Внизу виднелся закованный льдом ручей. 
| below be.visible covered ice stream
| A stream covered in ice was visible below.
