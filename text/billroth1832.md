### Gustav Billroth *Lateinische Syntax* [-@billroth1832]

At the end of his short life, Johann Gustav Willhelm Billroth (1808-1836) became professor for religion at the university in Halle. However, between his *Habilitation* in Leipzig in 1830 and the start of his position in Halle in 1834, he worked as a teacher for latin [@alwast2000]. In that context he wrote two latin grammars for use in schools, first the *Lateinische Syntax für die obern Klassen gelehrter Schulen* [@billroth1832], later followed by the *Lateinische Schulgrammatik für alle Klassen* [@billroth1834].

In these grammars there is a single graphical display of a grammatical structure, shown below in [@fig:billroth1832_102] [@billroth1832: 102]. There is not much known about the grammatical background of Billroth, nor is there any indication in his books about the inspiration for drawing a grammatical analysis. There are some indications that Billroth was influenced by Heyse's grammar of German (see below), specifically the fourth edition [@heyse1827]. However, the idea of drawing a sentence structure is nowhere to be found in Heyse's work, so this approach seems to be a genuinly new idea of Billroth.

The influence of Heyse on Billroth can be inferred by the usage of the peculiar tripartite basic sentence structure of subject, predicate and copula. Even more clearly, Heyse's influence is indicated by the metaphor of the *nackte* 'naked' and *bekleidete* 'dressed' sentence. The origin of this terminological distinction can be traced back to Meiner [-@meiner1781: 446], who uses the terms *bloß* 'bare' for a minimal sentence and *ausgebildet* 'developed' for a sentence with additional modifiers. This terminology is slightly changed in the first edition of Heyse's grammar of German [@heyse1814: 492-492] into *einfach/rein* 'simple/pure' and *ausgebildet/erweitert* 'developed/extended'. Then Heyse adjusted this again in the second edition by adding the term *nackt* 'naked, bare' as an alternative to *einfach* and *rein* [@heyse1820: 598]. Finally, in the fourth edition of 1827 he adds the term *bekleidet* 'dressed': 

> *Solche Sätze […] kann man ~~ausgebildete~~, erweiterte, oder (im Gegensatze zu den nackten) ~~bekleidete~~ Sätze nennen.* ('Such sentences can be called "developed", "extended" or (opposite to "naked") "dressed" sentences.') [@heyse1827: 636]

In Billroth's syntax, the whole discussion of the structure of the  sentence takes 11 pages [@billroth1832: 91-102]. The structure is really difficult to follow from the text itself, although on closer inspection there is a clear drawn-out structure. First he introduces the simple 'naked' sentence:

> *Ein Satz ist entweder: A. ein einfacher (oder nackter) d.h. ein solcher, welcher bloß aus Subject, Prädicat und Copula besteht.* ['A sentence is either: A. a simple (or naked) one i.e. one such that it only consists of subject, predicate and copula', @billroth1832: 91] 

It takes 8 pages of explanations of the simple sentence until finally the expected follow-up to the option *A* occurs. Innocuously on page 97 the option *B* is announced, using a rather strange sentence structure that only makes sense when it is read immediately after the option *A* as quoted above.

> *B. oder ein bestimmter (bekleideter) d.h. ein solcher, wo entweder ein einzelner Theil oder mehrere durch Zusätze näher bestimmt werden* ['B. or a determined (dressed) one, i.e. one such, in which either a single part or multiple parts are further determined by additions', @billroth1832: 97]

Then it takes another 5 pages of explanations of different kinds of such 'dressing' of a sentence until finally this topic is closed with the conclusion quoted below. Billroth simply states (without explanation) that the example [@next] is 'dressed' as shown in [@fig:billroth1832_102]. In this quote, Billroth takes the metaphor of the naked/dressed sentence even one step further by using the term *Körper* 'body' for the naked sentence.

> *Auf diese Weise wird z.B. folgender Satz [@next], dessen Körper eigentlich nur aus dem Subj.: Miltiades und dem Prädicat (mit dem Copula) reddidit besteht, bekleidet:* ['In this way, the following sentence, whose body only consists of the subject *Miltiades* and the predicate (with copula) *reddidit*, is dressed', @billroth1832: 102]

::: ex
Miltiades, dux Atheniensium, toti Graeciae libertatem paene oppressam in pugna apud Marathonem reddidit.

Interpreting his graphical explanation in more detail, the naked sentence is depicted by a horizonal line, while the additional elements of the dressed sentence are all shown as vertical lines. Billroth very clearly intends the vertical lines to represent some kind of dependency, with multiple levels of modification being illustrated by subsequent vertical lines.

Exactly the same approach with the same picture is found in his extended grammar written two years later [@billroth1834: 332-333]. After Billroth's early death this grammar has seen various new editions. The second edition of 1838 is prepared by Friedrich Ellendt and uses exactly the same figure [@billroth1838: 329]. However, in the third edition, the picture is changed, erroneously, and has become completely incomprehensible, cf. [@fig:billroth1848_358] [@billroth1848: 358]. Ellendt possibly did not completely understand what the figure is supposed to represent.

Billroth's grammar has an interesting afterlife, but unfortunately without any further development of his graphical innovation. Friedrich Ellendt writes a different grammer for younger students based on Billroth's model, called *Lateinische Grammatik für die unteren Klassen der Gymnasien*. The discussion of *bekleidete oder erweitete Sätze* is very similar to Billroth's, but it has different examples and it does not have a picture anymore [@ellendt1838: 115-116]. After the death of Ellendt, that grammar is in turn adapted by Moritz Seyffert as *Dr. Friedrich Ellendt's Lateinische Grammatik für die unteren und mittleren Klassen der höheren Unterrichtsanstalten*. This grammar has seen very many revisions, editions and reprints under the heading *Ellendt-Seyfferts lateinische Grammatik* far into the 20th Century. However, Seyffert was not very impressed by the syntactical analysis of Billroth (as noted in the preface of his revision), and he revised the discussion of syntax wholesale.

On a more positive note, Billroth's graphical display had a direct influence on Julius Hoffmann (see [@sec:hoffmann1839]), but also that incarnation of graphical grammar did not catch on.
