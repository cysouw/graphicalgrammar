## Introduction

## *Deutsche Sprachlehre* [@moritz1782] {#sec:moritz1782}

Karl Philipp Moritz (1756-1793) was a prolific author with wide ranging interests. Towards the end of his life he became professor for the arts at the *Königliche Akademie der Künste* in Berlin. Among his many writings there are various instructional books and articles about grammar, see Schmidt [-@schmidt1993] for a concise summary of his linguistic oeuvre. Of particular interest here is the *Deutsche Sprachlehre für die Damen in Briefen* [@moritz1782]. The context and linguistic content of this work is discussed in more detail by Buhofer [-@buhofer1994]. This book was quite successful, being reprinted in 1791, 1794 and 1806. All later editions dropped the somewhat curious addition *für die Damen* from the title.

The *Deutsche Sprachlehre* contains to my knowledge the first graphical display of a grammatical analysis. In the *Zehnter Brief: Von dem Bau der Rede*, starting on page 267, Moritz discusses various simple examples, culminating in two large fold-out page-inserts between pages 308 and 309, reproduced here in [@fig:moritz1782i] and [@fig:moritz1782ii]. Later, in the first volume of his 1793 *Grammatisches Wörterbuch der deutschen Sprache* there is a short summary of this grammatical analysis under the heading of *Construcktion* [@moritz1793: 283-295]. After Moritz' early demise that same year (at only 37 years of age) this *Grammatisches Wörterbuch* was completed by other authors without any further mentioning of this new kind of sentence analysis. The most extensive exposition of Moritz' envisioned analysis thus remains the discussion in the 1782 *Deutsche Sprachlehre*.

Moritz' linguistic analysis is particularly noteworthy because it is an early version of what later will be called a *Satzgliedanalyse* ('phrasal analysis'). Although Moritz consistently talks about the "words" of the sentence, he clearly intends these "words" to be something closer to what today would be called phrases. These phrases are classified into various functions, using German labels for didactic purposes (e.g. *Grund*=subject, *Ziel*=accusative object, *Zweck*=dative indirect object). Forsgren [@forsgren1985: 76], discussing the origin of such phrasal analyses at the end of the 18th Century, argues that Moritz' approach is one of the earliest examples of a phrasal analysis and his ideas appears to be developed independently from other contemporaries.

![First page insert in *Deutsche Sprachlehre* [@moritz1782: 308]. Individual clauses are marked by a numbered bracket. Note the graphically lowered adjuncts (*Hinanfügung*) and the subordinated direct speech clauses (clause 9 and 10).](figures/moritz1782_308i.png){#fig:moritz1782i}

![Second page insert in *Deutsche Sprachlehre* [@moritz1782: 308]. Note another example of a subordinated direct speech (clause 13) and a subordinated adverbial *um zu+Infiniv* clause (clause 21).](figures/moritz1782_308ii.png){#fig:moritz1782ii}

Examining the details of this visual display, each clause can be identified by a large bracket. Within each clausal bracket there is a table-like structure with function-names on top and the actual words of the clause below. Each clause consists of *Grund* ("subject") and *Rede* ("predicate"), with possibly additional syntactic functions like *Ziel* ("accusative object"), *Zweck* ("dative object") or *Bindung* ("conjunction"). Optional elements like *Hinanfügung* ("adverbial phrase") and *Einschiebung* ("interjection") are placed loosely below the main syntactic functions, implicitly hinting at an argument/adjunct distinction. Various details are not completely thought through and the examples are sometimes slightly inconsistent. For example, the phrase *von der Schulter* in clause 11 is analyzed as an adverbial *Hinanfügung*, while the completely parallel *auf die Schulter* in clause 18 is analyzed as an object-like *zweites Ziel*.

More interesting is the treatment of subordinate clauses. Subordinate clauses are given a function in the matrix clause and then are further analyzed within a new bracket as a separate clause below. This can be seen in [@fig:moritz1782ii] with the analysis of direct speech in clause 13, which is the *Ziel* of the matrix clause 12. Likewise, the adverbial *um zu+Infinitiv* subordinate clause 21 is the *Zweck* of the matrix clause 20. 

This display of subordinate clauses is no coincidence. In the text there is an explicit discussion of this analysis of subordinate clauses [@moritz1782: 299-300] based on the example sentence [@next]. This sentence is analyzed by Moritz into four separate clauses. The four clauses and their functions in the superordinate clause are listed in [@next a-d], as shown in [@fig:moritz1782sub1]. Each of these subordinate clauses is subsequently analyzed using the same clausal analysis structure as the superordinate clause, as can be seen in [@fig:moritz1782sub2].

![Separate analyses of the subordinate clauses of the complex sentence in [@last] from *Deutsche Sprachlehre* [@moritz1782: 300].](figures/moritz1782_300.png){#fig:moritz1782sub2}

Nitpicking one might argue that this analysis of the complex sentence is not completely correct. Clause 2 from [@fig:moritz1782sub2] is not a separate clause but the superordinate clause itself. Further, The subordinate part *um vergnügt und glücklich zu sein* is analyzed in [@fig:moritz1782sub1] as *Zweck* ('reason', confusingly a label otherwise also used for dative arguments by Moritz). However, this clause is not directly subordinate to the main clause *so fühle ich* but it is secondary subordinate to the *Ziel* complement clause *daß mir dieses genug ist*. 

Notwithstanding these inaccuracies, Moritz' analysis shows a clear understanding of subordinate clauses simultaneously having an internal functional structure and, as a whole clause, having a function inside a superordinate structure. Anachronistically interpreting this as a constituency analysis, this sentence can be displayed as shown in [@fig:moritz1782_300tree]. Note that this is somewhat akin to an "underlying" structure as the ordering does not correspond to the original sentence. Moritz consistently applies the same functional structure on each clause (viz. the ordering *Grund-Rede-Ziel-Zweck-Hinanfügung*). The numbering in this examples indicates the eventual ordering in the resulting sentence.

![Constituency tree of the example in [@last] following the analysis from Moritz [@moritz1782: 299-300]. Note the fixed ordering of the functional categories in each clause, making this a kind of "underlying" structure. The bracketed numbers indicate the ordering in the actual example.](figures/moritz1782_300tree){#fig:moritz1782_300tree}

Summarizing, Moritz appears to have a clear understanding of, first, phrases as the basis of syntactic analysis. Second, he assigns a syntactic function to each phrase. Third, his examples indicate a basic, through rather implicit, understanding of adjuncts as less crucial phrases (*Hinanfügung*) that are visually displayed below the main constituents. Fourth, subordinate clauses have their own clausal structure, while the subordinate as a whole is assigned a function in the superordinate clause, which is a clear precursor of constituency structure. Finally, in the text he explicitly mentions that the ordering of the elements in the actual sentence is slightly different from the ordering in his analyses, and he hints at rules that determine how the abstract "underlying" structure has to be reordered into the actual form.

All these theoretical concepts are quite charmingly summarized by his graphical display, which can be interpreted as a kind of precursor of a constituency structure. Apparently appearing completely out of the blue, the idea of using graphics to elucidate grammatical structure is off to a great start with these proposals from Moritz' *Deutsche Sprachlehre*. Unfortunately, his approach does not have had any following and it would take another 50 years for graphical methods to be used again for grammatical analysis.

## *Periodenbau der deutschen Sprache* [@herling1823] {#sec:herling1823}

Simon Heinrich Adolf Herling (1780-1849) was a teacher in Frankfurt am Main and founding member, and later main organizer, of the *Frankfurter Gelehrtenverein für deutsche Sprache*. His analysis of multi-clause sentences is widely considered foundational for the grammatical analysis of German. A wide-ranging appraisal of Herling's work can be found in Elmentaler [-@elmentaler1996]. Herling is a close friend and colleague to Ferdinand Becker (see [@sec:becker1829]), who is also an active member of the *Frankfurter Gelehrtenvereion*. A plan to write a joint grammar fell apart, indicating different opinions in their approach to grammatical analysis [@haselbach1966: 69]. Their relation remains amicable, as indicated by the fact that the first part of Herling's *Syntax der deutschen Sprache* [@herling1830] is dedicated to Becker.

Strictly speaking, the work of Herling does not include any graphical display of grammatical analysis. However, his work is still included here because he introduces some notation that will be expanded upon graphically by later authors, especially Lehmann (see [@sec:lehmann1833]) and Götzinger (see [@sec:götzinger1836]). Herling's notational framework is first introduced in the *Grundregeln des deutschen Stils oder der Periodenbau der deutschen Sprache. Ein Lehrbuch für den stilistischen Unterricht* [@herling1823], which later becomes the second part of *Die Syntax der deutschen Sprache* (second edition 1827, third edition 1832).

In this book Herling analyses the different ways complex sentences are build from multiple clauses. He uses the term *Periode* for the complex sentence, a term that goes straight back to antiquity. Aristotle uses the term *περίοδος* 'periodos' to describe something akin to a complete sentence, consisting of multiple clauses (with *κῶλον* 'kolon' being used for something akin to a clause). Burkett explains that "the term *periodos* is one of Aristotle‘s visual metaphors, suggesting a circular motion or completeness of thought and rhythm." [@burkett2011: 206].

> *λέγω δὲ περίοδον λέξιν ἔχουσαν ἀρχὴν καὶ τελευτὴν αὐτὴν καθ᾽ αὑτὴν καὶ μέγεθος εὐσύνοπτον* (Aristoteles, Rhetorica III 9.3)^[Original online at the Perseus Digital Library < http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg038.perseus-grc1:3.9.3>.]
> 
> ['I call a period an expression having a beginning and an end in itself and a magnitude easily taken in at a glance.' translation by @burkett2011: 206]

The term *Periode* as a grammatical term for the complex sentence is widespread in German 18th and 19th Century grammatical texts. It is used already by Meiner [-@meiner1781: 446] and Heyse [-@heyse1814: 491] and appears in all didactic works to be discussed later in this chapter.

In a short note inserted in the main text, Herling proposes a special notation *um die Umformungen kürzer zu bezeichnen, und so leichter überschauen zu können* ['to succinctly mark the transformations and thus be able to survey them more easily' @herling1823: 177]. The usage of the term *Umformung* deserves it's own discussion, which will not be pursued here. The special notation is summarized slightly clearer in the second and third edition [e.g. @herling1832: 232]. The version from the third edition is shown here in the [@fig:herling1832_232], which can be translated as follows:

> For the succinct marking of the sentences and their syntactic relationships may the following symbols be of use: *h* indicates grammatical main sentence; *b* adjective clause, *β*, when it is shortened; *a* adverbial clause, *α*, the same shortened; *s* nominal clause, *σ* the same shortened. The exponents, e.g. *a^2^* indicate the grammatical grade, to *h* e.g. *h^2^* the grade of the logical gradation; *h/2*, *h/3*, indicates that the main clause, or *a/2*, *a/3* that the adverbial clause is separated into two or three parts. The coefficients e.g. *2h* indicate the number of equivalent main clauses; with *a*, *b*, *s* their relationship to the main clauses, often their coordination. [@herling1832: 232]

![Notation of Herling [-@herling1832] for the analysis of subordinate clauses in complex sentence structure. The different letters have a grammatical meaning, with *h* for main clauses, *b* for relative clauses, *a* for adverbial clauses and *s* for nominal clauses. Superscript numbers are used for the depth of the embedding.](figures/herling1832_232.png){#fig:herling1832_232}

Herling does not use his notations consistently throughout his book. There are only a few incidental examples and there are almost no sentences completely marked according to his system. The example in [@next] is one of the more interesting and complex cases [@herling1832: 233]. Yet, in contrast to intended purpose, the abstract analysis with letters and numbers, interspersed inside the sentence, does not really ease the quick appraisal of the sentence structure, in my opinion.

[@herling1832: 233]
:::

Interpreting Herling's analysis in modern terms, his symbols can be seen as a constituency structure. All clauses in the complex sentence are given a label and are related to each other in a hierarchical fashion, distinguishing coordination (viz. number in front) from subordination (viz. special letters for different kinds of embedding and superscript numbers to indicate deeper levels of embedding). Crucially, the clauses are linked to each other without using specific words as anchor points, like they would be in a dependency structure (cf. Becker's sentence analysis of a complex sentence, see [@sec:becker1829]). [@fig:herling1832_233tree] shows an interpretation of Herling's analysis from [@last] in the form of a constituency tree.

## *Lateinische Syntax* [@billroth1832] {#sec:billroth1832}

At the end of his short life, Johann Gustav Willhelm Billroth (1808-1836) became professor for religion at the university in Halle. Before that, between his *Habilitation* in Leipzig in 1830 and the start of his position in Halle in 1834, he worked as a teacher for latin [@alwast2000]. In that context he wrote two latin grammars for use in schools, first the *Lateinische Syntax für die obern Klassen gelehrter Schulen* [@billroth1832], later followed by the *Lateinische Schulgrammatik für alle Klassen* [@billroth1834].

In these grammars there is a single graphical display of a grammatical structure, shown below in [@fig:billroth1832_102] [@billroth1832: 102]. There is not much known about the grammatical background of Billroth, nor is there any indication in his books about the inspiration for drawing a grammatical analysis. There are some indications that Billroth was influenced by Heyse's grammar of German (see below), specifically the fourth edition [@heyse1827]. However, the idea of drawing a sentence structure is nowhere to be found in Heyse's work, so this approach seems to be a genuinly new idea of Billroth.

The influence of Heyse on Billroth can be inferred by the usage of the peculiar tripartite basic sentence structure of subject, predicate and copula. Even more clearly, Heyse's influence is indicated by the metaphor of the *nackte* 'naked' and *bekleidete* 'dressed' sentence. The origin of this terminological distinction can be traced back to Meiner [-@meiner1781: 446], who uses the terms *bloß* 'bare' for a minimal sentence and *ausgebildet* 'developed' for a sentence with additional modifiers. Contemporaneously, Adelung [-@adelung1782: 572] uses the terms *einfach/nackt* 'simple/naked' and *ausgebildet* 'developed'. This terminology is slightly changed in the first edition of Heyse's grammar of German [@heyse1814: 492-492] into *einfach/rein* 'simple/pure' and *ausgebildet/erweitert* 'developed/extended'. Then Heyse adjusted this again in the second edition by adding the term *nackt* 'naked, bare' as an alternative to *einfach* and *rein* [@heyse1820: 598]. Finally, in the fourth edition of 1827 he adds the term *bekleidet* 'dressed': 

> *Solche Sätze […] kann man ~~ausgebildete~~, erweiterte, oder (im Gegensatze zu den nackten) ~~bekleidete~~ Sätze nennen.* ('Such sentences can be called "developed", "extended" or (opposite to "naked") "dressed" sentences.') [@heyse1827: 636]

In Billroth's syntax, the whole discussion of the structure of the  sentence takes 11 pages [@billroth1832: 91-102]. The structure of the text is really difficult to follow, although on closer inspection there is a clear drawn-out organisation. First, he introduces the simple 'naked' sentence as option *A*:

> *Ein Satz ist entweder: A. ein einfacher (oder nackter) d.h. ein solcher, welcher bloß aus Subject, Prädicat und Copula besteht.* ['A sentence is either: A. a simple (or naked) one i.e. one such that it only consists of subject, predicate and copula', @billroth1832: 91] 

It takes 8 pages of explanations of the simple sentence until finally the expected follow-up to the option *A* occurs. Without clear formatting, the option *B* is announced innocuously on page 97, using a rather strange sentence structure that only makes sense when it is read immediately after the option *A* as quoted above.

> *B. oder ein bestimmter (bekleideter) d.h. ein solcher, wo entweder ein einzelner Theil oder mehrere durch Zusätze näher bestimmt werden* ['B. or a determined (dressed) one, i.e. one such, in which either a single part or multiple parts are further determined by additions', @billroth1832: 97]

Then it takes another 5 pages of explanations of different kinds of such "dressed" sentences until finally this topic is closed with the conclusion quoted below. Billroth simply states (without explanation) that the example sentence [@next] is 'dressed' as illustrated in [@fig:billroth1832_102]. In this quote, Billroth takes the metaphor of the naked/dressed sentence even one step further by using the term *Körper* 'body' for the naked sentence.

> *Auf diese Weise wird z.B. folgender Satz [@next], dessen Körper eigentlich nur aus dem Subj.: Miltiades und dem Prädicat (mit dem Copula) reddidit besteht, bekleidet:* ['In this way, the following sentence, whose body only consists of the subject *Miltiades* and the predicate (with copula) *reddidit*, is dressed', @billroth1832: 102]

:::

![Graphical sentence analysis of [@last] from Billroth [-@billroth1832: 102].](figures/billroth1832_102.png){#fig:billroth1832_102}

Interpreting his graphical illustration in more detail, the naked sentence is depicted by a horizonal line, while the additional elements of the "dressed" sentence are all shown as vertical/slanted lines. Billroth very clearly intends the vertical lines to represent some kind of dependency, with multiple levels of modification being illustrated by subsequent vertical lines.

Exactly the same approach with the same picture is found in his extended grammar written two years later [@billroth1834: 332-333]. After Billroth's early death this grammar has seen various new editions. The second edition of 1838 is prepared by Friedrich Ellendt and uses exactly the same figure [@billroth1838: 329]. However, in the third edition, the picture is changed, erroneously, and has become completely incomprehensible, cf. [@fig:billroth1848_358] [@billroth1848: 358]. Ellendt possibly did not completely understand what the figure is supposed to represent.

![Revision from 1848](figures/billroth1848_358.png){#fig:billroth1848_358}

Billroth's grammar has an interesting afterlife, but unfortunately without any further development of his graphical innovation. Friedrich Ellendt writes a different grammer for younger students based on Billroth's model, called *Lateinische Grammatik für die unteren Klassen der Gymnasien*. The discussion of *bekleidete oder erweitete Sätze* is very similar to Billroth's, but it has different examples and it does not have a picture anymore [@ellendt1838: 115-116]. After the death of Ellendt, that grammar is in turn adapted by Moritz Seyffert as *Dr. Friedrich Ellendt's Lateinische Grammatik für die unteren und mittleren Klassen der höheren Unterrichtsanstalten*. This grammar has seen very many revisions, editions and reprints under the heading *Ellendt-Seyfferts lateinische Grammatik* far into the 20th Century. However, Seyffert was not very impressed by the syntactical analysis of Billroth (as noted in the preface of his revision), and he revised the discussion of syntax wholesale.

On a more positive note, Billroth's graphical display had a direct influence on Julius Hoffmann (see [@sec:hoffmann1839]), but also that incarnation of graphical grammar did not catch on. One could speculate whether there is any influence from either Billroth or Hoffmann on the graphical analysis of Franz Kern (see [@sec:kern1883]), but there is little evidence for that.

## *Allgemeiner Mechanismus des Periodenbaues* [@lehmann1833] {#sec:lehmann1833}

Johann August Otto Leopold Lehmann (1802-1883) worked as a teacher in Danzig (Gdańsk) and later as a school principal in Marienwerder (Kwidzyn). In this context, he prepared various educational textbooks, mainly consisting of literary commentaries, but also including songbooks, dialect analyses and some works on local history. Early in his career he wrote a linguistic treatise about the structure of the complex sentence: *Allgemeiner Mechanismus des Periodenbaues, nebst einem Versuche, an ihn eine Kritik der deutschen Periode anzuknüpfen* [@lehmann1833]. His approach to the analysis of complex sentences is based on the work of Herling (see [@sec:herling1823]), who is explicitly cited as a source of inspiration [@lehmann1833: xv-xvi]. 

In the title of his book, Lehmann uses the term *Periode*, which is a term also used by Herling. This term stems from the domain of rhetoric and roughly indicates a coherent and well-structured utterance. Continuing the tradition of Herling, Lehmann uses the term *Periode* to designate a complex sentence that consists of multiple clauses. Herling already introduced symbolic abbreviations for different kinds of clauses (see [@sec:herling1823]), but Lehmann takes this a step further and proposes a comprehensive visualization of the structure of a complex sentence, which he calls a *Periodenbild*.

> *[Die] innere Anschauung der Periode soll als auf äußere Anschauung begründet dargestellt werden. Die äußere Anschauung aber findet ihr Objekt in Bildern, welche das Skelet der Perioden wiedergeben. Ich nenne dies Periodenskelet ~~Anschauungsbild der Periode~~ oder ~~Periodenbild~~ schlechtweg.* [@lehmann1833: xiv]
> 
> ('The internal structure of the *Periode* will be depicted based on the outward appearance. The outward appearance shows itself as a picture, which reflects the skeleton of the *Periode*. I simply call this *Periode*-skeleton an ~~image of the Periode~~ or a ~~Periode-picture~~.) 

For the visualization of a *Periodenbild* Lehmann distinguishes three different kinds of subordination, indicated by different symbolic devices as shown in [@fig:lehmann1833_58] [@lehmann1833: 58]. These three notations basically indicate a subordinate position after (1), before (2) and internal (3) to the superordinate clause, respectively. More precisely, 

- the first notation uses a horizontal brace, which indicates that the subordinate clause (below the brace) follows the superordinate clause (above the brace). This is called *Anfügung* or *Nachperiode*;
- the second notation uses a colon, which indicates that the subordinate clause (in front of the colon) is positioned before the main clause. This is called *Vordersatz*, *Vorderperiode* or *Vorausschickung*;
- the third notation uses round brackets, which indicates that the subordinate clause (inside the brackets) is positioned inside the superordinate clause. This is called an *Einschaltung*. The separated parts of the superordinate clause are indicated by repeating the same letter. Such repetitions of the same letter thus do not indicate multiple clauses, but separate parts of the same clause.

![Three basic structural mechanisms of subordination from Lehmann [-@lehmann1833: 58]. The first (with a horizontal brace) indicated that the subordination follows the main clause; the second (with a colon) indicates that the subordination precedes the main clause; and the third (with round brackets) indicated that the subordination is positioned internal to the main clause.](figures/lehmann1833_58.png){#fig:lehmann1833_58}

At first glance it seems curious that there are completely different notation for the placement in front (colon) and the placement behind (horizontal brace). However, there is clear rationale for this difference arising from the structural possibilities of the German language (although this rationale is not explained by Lehmann in his book). The German main clause has a special initial position (today mostly called *Vorfeld*) that can contain a single subordinate clause. So each main clause can only have a single *Vordersatz*, which Lehmann indicates with the colon. Internal and final subordination can be recursively repeated.

Lehmann's book completely focusses on the analysis of complex sentences into their constituting clauses, using his graphical display to summarize the relationships between the clauses. There are hundreds of examples of different kinds of complex sentences discussed in his book, but there is not a single analysis of a clause-internal structure at all. He appears to be much more interested in the number of possible schemas that could exist, which are all *Umformungen* of a complex sentence. For example, he discusses an example of a particular schematic analysis (apparently without any real linguistic sentence in mind) that could theoretically have 37,632 *Umformungen* [@lehmann1833: 116-118]. Lehmann immediately notes *"Es wäre thöricht, bei dieser oder ähnlichen Perioden, die zu den Verwickeltsten gehören, all möglichen Veränderungen darzustellen."* ['It would be foolish for such or similar *Perioden*, that belong to the most complex ones, to illustrate all possible changes.' @lehmann1833: 116-118].

Clauses are indicated by using letters, an approach that was also used by Herling (cf. [@sec:herling1823]). However, Lehmann has a completely different approach to the use of the letters. Lehmann is only interested in the relative ordering of the subordinated clauses and he completely ignores what kind of subordination is used. In contrast, Herling uses different letters for different grammatical kinds of subordinated clauses, for example *a* for adverbial clauses. When there are three adverbial clauses in a sentence, then they are all called *a* by Herling. The letters are thus indications of the grammatical kind of the clause. Lehmann instead uses a different letter for each subordinate clause, giving each clause an individual label, but omitting any indication of the internal structure.

This difference between Herling and Lehmann also concerns the use of Greek letters. Herling uses greek letters for non-finite subordinate clauses (using *zu*-infinitive or participial verb forms in German), but Lehmann does not consider non-finite clauses at all. He uses greek letters for doubly-embedded subordinate clauses. In contrast, Herling uses numerical superscripts for multiple grades of embedding. Lehmann uses different kinds of scripts to distinguish multiple grades of embedding. He uses capital letters for main clauses, lower-case letters for subordinate clauses and greek letters for doubly-embedded clauses. Third-grade embedding uses Fraktur capital letters (e.g. 𝔄, 𝔅) and fourth-grade embedding uses Fraktur lower-case letter (e.g. 𝔞, 𝔟). There is even a short discussion of a fifth-grade embedding, which is indicated with numerals [@lehmann1833: 232].

In contrast to Herling, Lehmann's approach thus ignores many apects of the grammatical analysis of a sentence. However, his focus on the relation between clauses allows him in return to tackle really complex sentences. Consider, for example, the long and complex sentence in [@next], which is a sentence from Immanuel Kant's *Anthropologie in pragmatischer Hinsicht* [@lehmann1833: 125-126]. The internal structure of this sentence is summarized by Lehmann with a relatively simple *Periodenbild* as shown in [@fig:lehmann1833_126].

Although Lehmann's book does not appear to have been reprinted after the first edition from 1833, it has influences later more widely read works by Götzinger (see [@sec:götzinger1836]) and Bauer (see [@sec:bauer1850]), whose graphical displays will be reprinted up to 1935. Götzinger's acknowledgement indicates that Lehmann's approach might have had some real influence in didactic circles, although it has not endured to the present day:

## *Die deutsche Sprache* [@gotzinger1836] {#sec:götzinger1836}

Maximilian Wilhelm Götzinger (1799–1856) was a teacher of German, most of his life working in Schaffhausen (Switzerland). He wrote extensively about grammar, literature and dialectology, see Olsson [-@olsson2009] for an comprehensive appraisal of his work. Besides his didactic writings, Götzinger also provided material for Grimm's dictionary project [@olsson2009: 37] and he was even awarded a doctorate *honoris causa* from the University of Basel in 1838 [@olsson2009: 36], probably through his personal contact with Wilhelm Wackernagel (the father of Jacob Wackernagel of *Wackernagel's law*-fame).

Götzinger wrote two didactic grammatical textbooks, both of which appeared in many different editions throughout the 19th Century [see @olsson2009: 42-46 for a list of all editions]. The book *Die Anfangsgründe der deutschen Sprachlehre in Regeln und Aufgaben* was first published in Leipzig in 1825. This was followed in quick succession by the *Deutsche Sprachlehre für Schulen*, first published in 1827 in Aarau. Originally, both these books did not contain any graphical analyses of sentences. A few years later, when revising his didactic grammars once again, he included graphical displays as discussed below, both in the fifth edition of the *Deutsche Sprachlehre* [@gotzinger1842: 222-226, 287-291] and in the fifth edition of the *Anfängsgründe* [@gotzinger1845: 236-242].

There is a curious graphic in the first edition of the *Deutsche Sprachlehre für Schulen* [@gotzinger1827: 263], reproduced here in [@fig:götzinger1827_263]. This graphical display purports to show different ways in which clauses can be coordinated to form a *Periode*. Although he lists various literary examples of such structures [@gotzinger1827: 264], it remains unclear how exactly this analysis is supposed to work. From the graphic it appears as if there should always be a central pair of clauses, but there is no explanation how to extract this central pair. The examples in the text seem to illustrate coordinated structures with a single central clause. For example, [@next] illustrates the option *Viergliedrig c)*, but this one clearly has the principal clause at the end.

The examples in the text make clear that these graphical displays are intended for coordinated structures, but it remains unclear how the graphically indicated central pair should be interpreted. ](figures/götzinger1827_263.png){#fig:götzinger1827_263}

3rd edition of *Sprachlehre* cites the influence of Lehmann [@gotzinger1835: xiii-xiv] and applies his graphical analysis to clause structure. Section *Stellungen der Bekleidung* [@gotzinger1835: 243-248] and *Stellung der Nebensätze* [@gotzinger1835: 310-315]

He uses term *Periodenbild* [@gotzinger1839: 395; @gotzinger1842: 307-311] just like Lehmann. Term *Satzbild* only introduced by Bauer?

A decade after the first editions of his textbooks Götzinger writes his magnum opus *Die deutsche Sprache und ihre Literatur* [volume one -@gotzinger1836; volume two -@gotzinger1839]. This book includes various graphical analyses, which are clearly inspired by the *Periodenbilder* from Lehmann (see [@sec:lehmann1833]). Götzinger does not explicitly cite Lehmann as his inspiration for the graphical display, but he mentions Lehmann's *vortreffliches Buch* ('excellent book') in a different context [@gotzinger1839: 217]. In a later preface to a different book he explicitly explains how he adapted and extended Lehmann's display [@gotzinger1842: vi].

Summarising, Lehmann (see [@sec:lehmann1833]) used a capital letter for a main clause and lower-case letters for subordinate clauses. Depending on position, there are three different methods to depict subordination. First, a subordinate clause in front of the main clause is separated by a colon. Second, a subordinate clause after the main clause is written below the main clause with a horizontal brace. Third, a clause-internal subordinate clause is written in round brackets.

Lehmann used his graphical method only for subordinated clauses, but Götzinger argues that the same idea of subordination (*Unterordnung*) can be used for other kinds of linguistic structure as well. Consequently, Götzinger uses Lehmann's notation also for (i) syllabic structure, (ii) clause-internal structure and (iii) clause subordination.

> *Auf diese Weiße ordnet die Sprache bei allen Vorgängen den jedesmaligen Stoff so, daß ein Theil desselben als untergeordnet erscheint, in der Silbe die Laute, im Worte die Silben, im Satze die Worte, in der Periode die Sätze.* [@gotzinger1836: 15]
> 
> ('Accordingly, language arranges the particular content in all occurrences in such a way that one part of it appears as subordinated: with syllables the sounds, with words the syllables, with clauses the words, with sentences the clauses.')

First, for the analysis of the syllable, Götzinger [-@gotzinger1836: 221-224] uses the capital letter for the vowel as the centre of the syllable (*Träger und Mittelpunkt der Silbe*) and lower-case letters for the consontants as dependent on the vowel (*erscheint stets als untergeordnet*). As long as the syllabic structure is according to the sonority hierarchy (*musikalisches Gesetz*), it can be described as (multiple) prefixal and suffixal subordinations, as illustrated in [@fig:götzinger1836_223]. Extrasyllabic initial *s* and affricate codas *ps*, *tsch* and *chs* are illustrated with different structures not repeated here [@gotzinger1836: 224].

> *In der Regel findet bei der Gliederung der Silbe durch fortschreitende Unterordnung der Elemente ein Schwellen und Sinken, ein Steigen und Fallen, ein Crescendo und Decrescendo statt; d.h. die Silbe fängt mit dem lautlosesten Element an, geht zu dem tönenenden über, gelangt zur eigentlichen Stimme, und geht nun denselben Weg wieder abwärts, so daß mithin in jeder auf diese Weiße gebaute Silbe ein völlig musikalisisches Gesetz statt findet.* [@gotzinger1836: 222]
> 
> ('Normally, the arrangement of the syllable consists, by repeated subordination of the elements, of swelling and sinking, of rising and falling, of crescendo and decrescendo; i.e. the syllable starts with the most silent element, proceeds to the more sounding one, reaches the principal voice, and then follows the same path downwards again in such a way that each such constructed syllable obeys a completely musical law.')

![Syllables with a structure in accordance to the sonority hierarchy [@gotzinger1836: 223] have a vowel as nucleus (capital letter) and possibly multiple 'subordinate' consonants in the onset (lower-case letters separated horizontally with colons) and the coda (lower-case letters separated vertically with braces).](figures/götzinger1836_223.png){#fig:götzinger1836_223}

Second, for the analysis of the internal structure of a clause, Götzinger proposes to use the same notation [@gotzinger1839: 159-162]. A few examples are shown in [@fig:götzinger1839_161]. The capital letter now refers to the verb and the lower-case letters refer to the constituents. Götzinger calls the lower-cased elements *Bekleidung* (cf. the discussion in [@sec:billroth1832]). Today a German grammar would call them *Satzglied*. The German main clause structure with two verb positions is indicated by a repeated capital letter, called *trennbare Zusammensetzung* by Götzinger [-@gotzinger1839: 160]. Similar terminology can still be found in contemporaneous German grammars.

Relative to the main verb, the three possible positions of the *Bekleidung* (i.e. before, in between and after the verb) are called *Voraussendung, Anfügung, Einschiebung*, respectively [@gotzinger1839: 160]. They are indicated with a colon, a horizontal brace and round brackets in the tradition of Lehmann (see [@sec:lehmann1833]), who calls them *Vorausschickung, Anfügung* and *Einschaltung*. Today a German grammar would say *Vorfeld, Nachfeld* and *Mittelfeld*. Götzinger also observes one of the main generalisation of German main clause structure, namely that the *Voraussendung/Vorfeld* never consists of more than one *Bekleidung/Satzglied*. 

> *Mag also die Stellung der Bekleidung in jenem Satze seyn, wie sie will, immer wird nur das Bild entstehen [mit einer Voraussendung]. Niemals kann die Folge vorkommen [mit mehreren Voraussendungen].* [@gotzinger1839: 162]
>
> ('Although the position of the constituents in the sentence can be as it chooses, the resulting image will always have a single *Vorraussendung*. The ordering with multiple *Voraussendungen* cannot occur.')

![Main clause analysis from Götzinger [-@gotzinger1839: 161] using the same notation as for syllables. In modern grammatical terminology: the main verb is indicated by the capital letter, possibly two times in case of a separated verb. Other *Satzglieder* are indicated by lower-case letters. The *Vorfeld* is separated by a colon. The *Mittelfeld* is put between round brackets, with multiple constituents separated by commas. The *Nachfeld* is indicated below the horizontal brace, again with commas separating mulitple constituents.](figures/götzinger1839_161.png){#fig:götzinger1839_161}

Third, for the analysis of the multi-clause sentence (*Periode*)

subordination: 364-367, 371, Periode: 374-403

coordination (*Beiordnung*) with an equal sign (p.366)
He observes, that with multiple subordinate clauses there are examples that appear to have an empty second part of the main predicate, or, in modern terminology, an empty *rechte Satzklammer*. He uses a dash to indicate such zeros. (p.381)

Kern cites Hoffmann [@kern1888], but only in the second edition after he already published his "tree" metaphors. The idea for the "trees" is already in "Satzlehre", finished in December 1882, and practically applied in "Methodik" of 1883.

## *Neuhochdeutsche Grammatik* [@bauer1850] {#sec:bauer1850}

Friedrich Bauer (1812-1874) studied theology and was the founding director of a missionary education centre in the Bavarian city of Neuendettelsau. This institute is still active today as *Mission EineWelt*. Among other duties, Bauer also taught religion and German grammar at his institute [@fuchshuber2013: 93]. In that context he wrote the *Grundzüge der neuhochdeutschen Grammatik für die unteren und mittleren Klassen höherer Bildungsanstalten*, which was first published in 1850. Bauer himself delivered various editions of this book up to his death in 1874.

summary of many editions in [@fuchshuber2013: 128-131]

After Bauer's death, the German dictionary maker Konrad Duden kept producing new editions of this grammar with only very minor changes. The *Neuhochdeutsche Grammatik* remained popular and has seen at least 27 editions, including special editions for Austria, for protestant schools and for catholic schools. The last edition was published in 1912 [@fuchshuber2013: 115-117, 128-131]. However, even that was not the end, as Bauer's text was given a second life. In the century since the death of Konrad Duden in 1911, Duden's dictionary became a household name in Germany for everything related to the German language. In 1935, under the auspice of Otto Basler, the 11th Edition of the Duden dictionary was expanded with a German grammar [@basler1935], which was basically a new edition of Bauer's *Neuhochdeutsche Grammatik*, which still includes the graphical analysis (without clear attribution to Bauer). Only after the Second World War was the grammar completely rewritten and new editions of that new Duden grammar are still popular today. The graphical display was removed from this rewritten Duden grammar.

(Bauer knew Hoffmann's grammar, [@fuchshuber2013: 99])

In the grammatical analysis of complex sentences, Bauer [-@bauer1850: 94-97] uses a graphical display in the tradition of Lehmann (see [@sec:lehmann1833]), although he does not explicitly cite him (Maybe Bauer got it from Götzinger?). The first similarity is that Bauer's analysis only deals with the relation between main and subordinate clauses, not clause-internal structure. Second, and most telling, Bauer follows Lehmann's convention to use capital letters for main sentences and lower-case letters for subordinate sentences. And finally, after a few pages of examples, Bauer comments, almost as an afterthought, that this analysis is called ~~periode~~, a clear implicit reference to Lehmann (and his inspiration, Herling [-@herling1823]). 

> *Die künstmäßige Gliederung mehrerer Sätze in beigeordneter oder untergeordneter Verbindung zu einem ganzen heißt man Periode* ['The artful arrangement of multiple sentences in coordinate or subordinate juncture into a whole is called *Periode*', @bauer1850: 97, translation MC].

Term "Satzbild" not in first edition of 1850, but introduced later, at least in sixth edition [@bauer1863]

The first few basic examples of Bauer's syntactic analysis are shown in [@fig:bauer1850_95] [@bauer1850: 95]. These examples are also found in exactly the same layout 85 years later in Basler [-@basler1935: 254]. Each sentence is analyzed in two ways: the text itself is subdivided into clauses, with subordinate clauses shifted down vertically and connected with lines (is this inspired by Hoffmann?). Additionally, there are structural analyses in the form of letters, with capital letters for main clauses and lower-case letters for subordinate clauses. First-level subordination is separated by a comma, while secondary or deeper subordination is indicated by vertical lines (and sometimes numerical superscripts). The vertical arrangement is clearly borrowed from Lehmann (although Bauer leaves out the horizontal brace from Lehmann), but the superscripts indicate that Bauer also took notice of Herling's notation (cf. [@sec:herling1823]).

Different lower-case letters, just like Herling, though the letters are different! [@bauer1850: 94]. "verkürzte" subordinate clauses have dashes -a-, -b-, -c-, but he later notes that this is supposed to be a strikethrough [@bauer1863: footnote on p. 145]

- Substantivsatz: a
- Adjectivsatz: b
- Adverbialsatz: c

This analysis is rather similar to a constituency analysis with the abstract letters indicating the node labels and the clauses being the leaves. Specifically, subordination is not linked to an explicit superordinate word (i.e. to a head as in a dependency analysis), but to a superordinate abstract entity.

![Basic examples of Bauer's sentence analysis [@bauer1850: 95]. There are three sentences analyzed in this excerpt, with subordination structure indicated by vertical lines and the structural patterns to the side, summarized with letters.](figures/bauer1850_95.png){#fig:bauer1850_95}

A more complex example discussed by Bauer is the sentence [@next], analyzed as [@fig:bauer1850_97] [@bauer1850: 97]. Again, there is both an analysis of all main and subordinate clauses, written out with subordination marked by vertical lines, and there is a structural pattern with letters and symbols in the bottom right. This structural pattern has two cases of coordination (marked by a plus symbol), an internal subordination (marked by the brackets), a secondary subordination (marked by a vertical line) and a subordination at the end of the sentence (marked by a comma). I have attempted to combine both these analysis into a single constituency tree as shown in [@fig:bauer1850_97tree]. The structural pattern has been used as the node-labels, while the text itself are the leaves in the tree. Probably it would have been more accurate to analyze the subordination *c* as a simple frontal embedding of the second conjunct, using a comma in the analysis instead of brackets for a clause-internal embedding (viz. *A+c,A,a+a* instead of *A+A(c)A,a+a*), but that is some minor nitpicking.
