### Johann August Lehmann: *Allgemeiner Mechanismus* [-@lehmann1833] {#sec:lehmann1833}

Johann August Otto Leopold Lehmann (1802-1883) worked as a teacher in Danzig (Gdańsk) and later as a school principal in Marienwerder (Kwidzyn). In this context, he prepared various educational textbooks, mainly consisting of literary commentaries, but also including songbooks, dialect analyses and some works on local history. Early in his career he wrote a linguistic treatise about the structure of the complex sentence: *Allgemeiner Mechanismus des Periodenbaues, nebst einem Versuche, an ihn eine Kritik der deutschen Periode anzuknüpfen* [@lehmann1833]. His approach to the analysis of complex sentences is based on the work of Herling (see [@sec:herling1823]), who is explicitly cited as a source of inspiration [@lehmann1833: xv-xvi]. 

In the title of his book, Lehmann uses the term *Periode*, which is a term also used by Herling. This term stems from the domain of rhetoric and roughly indicates a coherent and well-structured utterance. Continuing the tradition of Herling, Lehmann uses the term *Periode* to designate a complex sentence that consists of multiple clauses. Herling already introduced symbolic abbreviations for different kinds of clauses (see [@sec:herling1823]), but Lehmann takes this a step further and proposes a comprehensive visualization of the structure of a complex sentence, which he calls a *Periodenbild*.

> *[Die] innere Anschauung der Periode soll als auf äußere Anschauung begründet dargestellt werden. Die äußere Anschauung aber findet ihr Objekt in Bildern, welche das Skelet der Perioden wiedergeben. Ich nenne dies Periodenskelet ~~Anschauungsbild der Periode~~ oder ~~Periodenbild~~ schlechtweg.* [@lehmann1833: xiv]
> 
> ('The internal structure of the *Periode* will be depicted based on the outward appearance. The outward appearance shows itself as a picture, which reflects the skeleton of the *Periode*. I simply call this *Periode*-skeleton an ~~image of the Periode~~ or a ~~Periode-picture~~.) 

For the visualization of a *Periodenbild* Lehmann distinguishes three different kinds of subordination, indicated by different symbolic devices as shown in [@fig:lehmann1833_58] [@lehmann1833: 58]. These three notations basically indicate a subordinate position after (1), before (2) and internal (3) to the superordinate clause, respectively. More precisely, 

- the first notation uses a horizontal brace, which indicates that the subordinate clause (below the brace) follows the superordinate clause (above the brace). This is called *Anfügung* or *Nachperiode*;
- the second notation uses a colon, which indicates that the subordinate clause (in front of the colon) is positioned before the main clause. This is called *Vordersatz*, *Vorderperiode* or *Vorausschickung*;
- the third notation uses round brackets, which indicates that the subordinate clause (inside the brackets) is positioned inside the superordinate clause. This is called an *Einschaltung*. The separated parts of the superordinate clause are indicated by repeating the same letter. Such repetitions of the same letter thus do not indicate multiple clauses, but separate parts of the same clause.

![Three basic structural mechanisms of subordination from Lehmann [-@lehmann1833: 58]. The first (with a horizontal brace) indicated that the subordination follows the main clause; the second (with a colon) indicates that the subordination precedes the main clause; and the third (with round brackets) indicated that the subordination is positioned internal to the main clause.](figures/lehmann1833_58.png){#fig:lehmann1833_58}

At first glance it seems curious that there are completely different notation for the placement in front (colon) and the placement behind (horizontal brace). However, there is clear rationale for this difference arising from the structural possibilities of the German language (although this rationale is not explained by Lehmann in his book). The German main clause has a special initial position (today mostly called *Vorfeld*) that can contain a single subordinate clause. So each main clause can only have a single *Vordersatz*, which Lehmann indicates with the colon. Internal and final subordination can be recursively repeated.

Lehmann's book completely focusses on the analysis of complex sentences into their constituting clauses, using his graphical display to summarize the relationships between the clauses. There are hundreds of examples of different kinds of complex sentences discussed in his book, but there is not a single analysis of a clause-internal structure at all. He appears to be much more interested in the number of possible schemas that could exist, which are all *Umformungen* of a complex sentence. For example, he discusses an example of a particular schematic analysis (apparently without any real linguistic sentence in mind) that could theoretically have 37,632 *Umformungen* [@lehmann1833: 116-118]. Lehmann immediately notes *"Es wäre thöricht, bei dieser oder ähnlichen Perioden, die zu den Verwickeltsten gehören, all möglichen Veränderungen darzustellen."* ['It would be foolish for such or similar *Perioden*, that belong to the most complex ones, to illustrate all possible changes.' @lehmann1833: 116-118].

Clauses are indicated by using letters, an approach that was also used by Herling (cf. [@sec:herling1823]). However, Lehmann has a completely different approach to the use of the letters. Lehmann is only interested in the relative ordering of the subordinated clauses and he completely ignores what kind of subordination is used. In contrast, Herling uses different letters for different grammatical kinds of subordinated clauses, for example *a* for adverbial clauses. When there are three adverbial clauses in a sentence, then they are all called *a* by Herling. The letters are thus indications of the grammatical kind of the clause. Lehmann instead uses a different letter for each subordinate clause, giving each clause an individual label, but omitting any indication of the internal structure.

This difference between Herling and Lehmann also concerns the use of Greek letters. Herling uses greek letters for non-finite subordinate clauses (using *zu*-infinitive or participial verb forms in German), but Lehmann does not consider non-finite clauses at all. He uses greek letters for doubly-embedded subordinate clauses. In contrast, Herling uses numerical superscripts for multiple grades of embedding. Lehmann uses different kinds of scripts to distinguish multiple grades of embedding. He uses capital letters for main clauses, lower-case letters for subordinate clauses and greek letters for doubly-embedded clauses. Third-grade embedding uses Fraktur capital letters (e.g. 𝔄, 𝔅) and fourth-grade embedding uses Fraktur lower-case letter (e.g. 𝔞, 𝔟). There is even a short discussion of a fifth-grade embedding, which is indicated with numerals [@lehmann1833: 232].

In contrast to Herling, Lehmann's approach thus ignores many apects of the grammatical analysis of a sentence. However, his focus on the relation between clauses allows him in return to tackle really complex sentences. Consider, for example, the long and complex sentence in [@next], which is a sentence from Immanuel Kant's *Anthropologie in pragmatischer Hinsicht* [@lehmann1833: 125-126]. The internal structure of this sentence is summarized by Lehmann with a relatively simple *Periodenbild* as shown in [@fig:lehmann1833_126].

The main clause is designated with a capital letter *A*, which is interrupted twice by subordinated clauses designated by lower-case letters, *b* and *c*. A further subordinated clause *a* comes before the main clause, and is itself interrupted by a second-order subordination designated by greek letter *α*. After the main clause there is yet another subordinated clause *d*, which is followed by a secondary embedding *β*, which is interrupted by a tertiary embedding indicated by a Fraktur capital letter *𝔄*.](figures/lehmann1833_126.png){#fig:lehmann1833_126}

The different clauses in [@fig:lehmann1833_126] are listed below, exactly as it is explained in the text by Lehmann:

- **main clause A:** [clause *a* preceding] *diese Liebenswürdigkeit des Geschöpfs im Zeitraum seiner Entwicklung zur Menschheit, muß wohl auf Rechnung seiner Unschuld und Offenheit aller seiner noch fehlerhaften Aeußerungen* [clause *b* internal] *einerseits, andrerseits aber auf den natürlichen Hang der Ammen zum Wohlthun an einem Geschöpf* [clause *c* internal] *geschrieben werden* [clause *d* following]
- **subordinate clause *a*, preceding *A*:** *daß ferner* [clause *α* internal] *das Radbrechen der Wörter es für Mütter und Ammen so liebenswürdig macht es beständig zu herzen und zu küssen und Willens zum kleinen Befehlshaber zu verziehen*
- **subordinate clause *b*, internal to *A*:** *wobei noch kein Hehl und nichts Arges ist*
- **subordinate clause *c*, internal to *A*:** *welches einschmeichelnd sich der Willkür eines andern überläßt*
- **subordinate clause *d*, following *A*:** *da ihm eine Spielzeit eingewilligt wird, die glücklichste unter allen* [clause *β* following]
- **secondary subordinate clause *α*, internal to *a*:** *wenn es (das Kind) nun zu sprechen versucht*
- **secondary subordinate clause *β*, following *d*:** *wobei der Erzieher dadurch* [clause *𝔄* internal] *diese Annehmlichkeit nochmals genießt*
- **tertiary subordinate clause *𝔄*, internal to *β*:** *daß er sich selber gleichsam zum Kinde macht*

Although Lehmann's book does not appear to have been reprinted after the first edition from 1833, it has influences later more widely read works by Götzinger (see [@sec:götzinger1836]) and Bauer (see [@sec:bauer1850]), whose graphical displays will be reprinted up to 1935. Götzinger's acknowledgement indicates that Lehmann's approach might have had some real influence in didactic circles, although it has not endured to the present day:

> *Die von Herrn Director Lehmann in Marienwerden zuerst aufgestellten Periodenbilder haben bei vielen Schulmännern Beifall und Anwendung gefunden, und es macht mir große Freude, durch meine Lehrbücher zur Verbreitung dieser Methode, deren Verdienst ganz allein Herrn Lehmann gebührt, beigetragen zu haben.* [@gotzinger1842: x, Vorrede zur fünften Auflage]
