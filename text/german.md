## A mostly forgotten tradition

### German linguistics at its prime

The 19th Century is widely considered to be the heyday of German linguistics. Many of the great names from the history of linguistics were German scholars from this time period, like von Humboldt, Bopp, Grimm, Schleicher, Paul, and so on. Yet, none of these greats will be mentioned in this chapter. In contrast, most of the scholars that will be discussed here will be completely unfamiliar to most contemporeneous linguists. The main reason is that the well-known scholars from the 19th Century were not very much interested in syntactic analysis. In contrast, the more philologically and didactically interested linguists constantly were dealing with those long, complicated and even strange sentence structures that were produced by the well-respected and maybe even idolated authors and poets they were studying. To elucidate these long-winding sentences, either as part of their research into stilistic characteristics or to explain these structures to newer generations of philological students, many scholars started using graphical methods for syntactic analysis. Although many of the authors to be discussed in this chapter were pondering didactic consideration, there is also an important strain of stilistic research that was an important impetus for these developments.

### *Nackte Sätze* {#sec:nackt}

In German grammars of the 18th and 19th Century there is a widespread conceptual distinction between a bare and an extended sentence. A bare sentence is mostly defined as a sentence with only a subject and a predicate without any attributive or adverbial modifiers; a minimal sentence of sorts. The examples given always have intransitive verbs and it remains unclear whether transitive sentences also could be "bare". An extended sentence, in contrast, contains additional modifiers, though subordinate clauses are mostly relegated to yet further categories of sentence structure. This distinction is mostly referred to using the German words *nackt* 'naked' vs. *ausgebildet* 'developed'. However, there is some interesting variations and discussion throughout the 19th Century about exactly which word should be used.

The origin of this terminological distinction can probably be traced back to Meiner [-@meiner1781: 446], who uses the terms *bloß* 'bare' for a minimal sentence and *ausgebildet* 'developed' for a sentence with additional modifiers. Contemporaneously, Adelung [-@adelung1782: 572] uses the terms *einfach/nackt* 'simple/naked' and *ausgebildet* 'developed'. This terminology is slightly changed in the first edition of Heyse's influential grammar of German [@heyse1814: 492-492] into *einfach/rein* 'simple/pure' and *ausgebildet/erweitert* 'developed/extended'. Then Heyse adjusted this again in the second edition by adding the term *nackt* 'naked, bare' as an alternative to *einfach* and *rein* [@heyse1820: 598]. Finally, in the fourth edition of 1827 Heyse adds the term *bekleidet* 'dressed': 

> Solche Sätze […] kann man ~~ausgebildete~~, erweiterte, oder (im Gegensatze zu den nackten) ~~bekleidete~~ Sätze nennen. [@heyse1827: 636]
> 
> ('Such sentences can be called "developed", "extended" or (opposite to "naked") "dressed" sentences.')

The term *bekleidet* leads to a lot of discussion, because of the sexual connotations. The term *nackt* is not so much the problem, because this German word is used to refer to many situations without cover, like *nackter Boden* 'bare floor', and it is also regularly used metaphorically, like in *nackte Angst* 'sheer terror'. So, there is no sexual connotation with the usage of the word *nackt* when used in opposition to the words *ausgebildet* or *erweitert*. However, in opposition to the word *bekleidet* 'dressed' the meaning of the word *nackt* suddenly obtains a strong sexual connotation, clearly meaning 'nude'. Some authors [e.g. @billroth1834; @gotzinger1835] use *bekleidet*, maybe because they find it funny and consider it a nice joke to motivate students, while others strongly object to this choice of words as being vulgar, or at least tasteless.

> Man nennt solche Sätze, welche nur die wesentlichen (Haupt-) Satztheile enthalten, ~~nackte~~, und solche, welche auch noch andere Theile enthalten, (nicht: ~~bekleidete~~, sondern) ~~ausgebildete~~ oder erweiterte Sätze. [@diesterweg1830: 166]
>
> ('Sentences which contain only the essential (main) parts are called *nackt* 'naked', and those which also contain other parts are called (not: *bekleidet* 'dressed', but) *ausgebildet* 'developed' or *erweitert* 'expanded' sentences.)

> Von nackten und bekleideten Sätzen zu reden ist geschmacklos, von nackten und erweiterten ist nicht viel geschmackvoller und enthält außerdem einen schiefen Gegensatz, den man in keiner Schülerarbeit dulden würde. [@kern1883: 5]
>
> ('To speak of naked and dressed sentences is tasteless, to speak of naked and extended sentences is not much more tasteful and also contains a distorted contrast that would not be tolerated in any student's work.')

> Seit lange (ich weiß nicht, seit wann) wird in der deutschen Grammatik gelehrt, daß ein nackter Satz wie *die Sonne scheint* die ursprünglichste Satzform darstelle und daß die Erweiterungen in einem bekleideten Satze wie z.B. *die helle Sonne bescheint die erfrischten Fluren* ihrerseits aus nackten Sätzen hervorgegangen sind. [@delbruck1901: 150]

### *Periode*

The term *Periode* as a grammatical term for the complex sentence is widespread in German 18th and 19th Century grammatical texts. It is used already by Meiner [-@meiner1781: 446] and Heyse [-@heyse1814: 491] and appears in many works to be discussed in this chapter. The precise definition is constantly being disputed, but most authors use the term *Periode* for a complex sentence with many subordinated clauses.

This term that goes straight back to antiquity. Aristotle used the term *περίοδος* 'periodos' to describe something akin to a complete sentence, consisting of multiple clauses (with *κῶλον* 'kolon' being used for something akin to a clause). Burkett explains that "the term *periodos* is one of Aristotle‘s visual metaphors, suggesting a circular motion or completeness of thought and rhythm." [@burkett2011: 206].

> λέγω δὲ περίοδον λέξιν ἔχουσαν ἀρχὴν καὶ τελευτὴν αὐτὴν καθ᾽ αὑτὴν καὶ μέγεθος εὐσύνοπτον (Aristoteles, Rhetorica III 9.3)^[Original online at the Perseus Digital Library < http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0086.tlg038.perseus-grc1:3.9.3>.]
> 
> ['I call a period an expression having a beginning and an end in itself and a magnitude easily taken in at a glance.' translation from @burkett2011: 206]

The desire to summarise the structure of a complex *Periode* is a crucial starting point for the graphical analysis of sentences in 19th Century Germany, starting with Herling [-@herling1823, see [@sec:herling1823]]. The main tool that is used is a so-called *Periodenbild* 'image of a Period'. The basic idea is to assign some symbols to each clause, and then combine these symbols into a visualisation to illustrate the interrelation between the many clauses that make up a *Periode*. The term *Periodenbild* for the analysis of a multi-clause sentence was first used by August Lehmann [-@lehmann1833, see [@sec:lehmann1833]]. His proposal includes a distinction between capital letters for main clauses and lower-case letters for subordinate clauses, a principle that remains a fixture throughout all variants of these *Periodenbilder*. In contrast, almost all other details differ widely from author to author.

Friedrich Diesterweg [-@diesterweg1834, see [@sec:diesterweg1830]] adopted Lehmann's terminology and added the term *Satzbild* for the structure of a monoclausal sentence. The two terms *Periodenbild* and *Satzbild* return throughout the 19th Century, but they are used quite interchangeably. Even though many authors distinguish between two different graphical analyses, one for single-clause sentences and one for multi-clause sentences, Diesterweg's terminological distinction did not persist. Linguistic *Bilder* remain virulent for about 90 years, but then gradually fade away from linguistic memory at the start of the 20th Century.

## *Periodenbild* and *Satzbild*

### Moritz (1782) *Deutsche Sprachlehre* {#sec:moritz1782}

Karl Philipp Moritz (1756-1793) was a prolific author with wide ranging interests. Towards the end of his life he became professor for the arts at the *Königliche Akademie der Künste* in Berlin. Among his many writings there are various instructional books and articles about grammar, see Schmidt [-@schmidt1993] for a concise summary of his linguistic oeuvre and Eichinger [-@eichinger1998] for an extensive discussion of his work. Of particular interest here is the *Deutsche Sprachlehre für die Damen in Briefen* [@moritz1782]. The context and linguistic content of this work is discussed in more detail by Buhofer [-@buhofer1994]. This book was quite successful, being reprinted in 1791, 1794 and 1806. All later editions dropped the somewhat curious addition *für die Damen* from the title.

The *Deutsche Sprachlehre* contains to my knowledge the first graphical display of a grammatical analysis. In the *Zehnter Brief: Von dem Bau der Rede*, starting on page 267, Moritz discusses various simple examples, culminating in two large fold-out page-inserts between pages 308 and 309, reproduced here in [@fig:moritz1782_308i] and [@fig:moritz1782_308ii]. This is an analysis of the first part of the *Amyntas*, one of the many *Idyllen* published by Salomon Geßner in 1756, shown here in [@next].^[The original text by Geßner is available online at https://www.deutschestextarchiv.de/gessner_idyllen_1756/43, accessed 21 October 2025.]

Later, in the first volume of his 1793 *Grammatisches Wörterbuch der deutschen Sprache* there is a short summary of this grammatical analysis under the heading of *Construktion* [@moritz1793: 283-295]. After Moritz' early demise that same year (at only 37 years of age) this *Grammatisches Wörterbuch* was completed by other authors without any further mentioning of this new kind of sentence analysis. The most extensive exposition of Moritz' envisioned analysis thus remains the discussion in the 1782 *Deutsche Sprachlehre*.

Moritz' linguistic analysis is particularly noteworthy because it is an early version of what later will be called a *Satzgliedanalyse* ('phrasal analysis'). Although Moritz consistently talks about the "words" of the sentence, he clearly intends these "words" to be something closer to what today would be called phrases. These phrases are classified into various functions, using German labels for didactic purposes (e.g. *Grund*=subject, *Ziel*=accusative object, *Zweck*=dative indirect object). Forsgren [-@forsgren1985: 76], discussing the origin of such phrasal analyses at the end of the 18th Century, argues that Moritz' approach is one of the earliest examples of a phrasal analysis and his ideas appear to be developed independently from other contemporaries.

First page insert in *Deutsche Sprachlehre* [@moritz1782: 308]. Individual clauses are marked by a numbered bracket. Note the graphically lowered adjuncts (*Hinanfügung, Einschiebung*) and the subordinated direct speech clauses (clause 9 and 10).

Second page insert in *Deutsche Sprachlehre* [@moritz1782: 308]. Note another example of a subordinated direct speech (clause 13) and a subordinated adverbial *um zu+Infinitiv* clause (clause 21).
:::

Examining the details of this visual display, each clause can be identified by a large bracket. Within each clausal bracket there is a table-like structure with function-names on top and the actual words of the clause below. Each clause consists of *Grund* ("subject") and *Rede* ("predicate"), with possibly additional syntactic functions like *Ziel* ("accusative object"), *Zweck* ("dative object") or *Bindung* ("conjunction"). Optional elements like *Hinanfügung* ("adverbial phrase") and *Einschiebung* ("interjection") are placed loosely below the main syntactic functions, implicitly hinting at an argument/adjunct distinction. Various details are not completely thought through and the examples are sometimes slightly inconsistent. For example, the phrase *von der Schulter* in clause 11 is analysed as an adverbial *Hinanfügung*, while the completely parallel phrase *auf die Schulter* in clause 18 is analysed as an object-like *zweites Ziel*.

More interesting is the treatment of subordinate clauses. Subordinate clauses are given a function in the matrix clause and then are further analysed within a new bracket as a separate clause below. This can be seen in [@fig:moritz1782_308ii] with the analysis of direct speech in clause 13, which is the *Ziel* of the matrix clause 12. Likewise, the adverbial *um zu+Infinitiv* subordinate clause 21 is the *Zweck* of the matrix clause 20. 

This display of subordinate clauses is no coincidence. In the text there is an explicit discussion of this analysis of subordinate clauses [@moritz1782: 299-300] based on the example sentence [@next]. This sentence is analysed by Moritz into four separate clauses. The four clauses and their functions in the superordinate clause are listed in [@next a-d], as shown in [@fig:moritz1782_299]. Each of these subordinate clauses is subsequently analysed using the same clausal analysis structure as the superordinate clause, as can be seen in [@fig:moritz1782_300].

:::

::: {.im #moritz1782_300}
Separate analyses of the subordinate clauses of the complex sentence in [@last] from *Deutsche Sprachlehre* [@moritz1782: 300].
:::

Nitpicking one might argue that this analysis of the complex sentence is not completely correct. Clause 2 from [@fig:moritz1782_300] is not a separate clause but the superordinate clause itself. Further, The subordinate part *um vergnügt und glücklich zu sein* is analysed in [@fig:moritz1782_299] as *Zweck* ('reason', confusingly a label otherwise also used for dative arguments by Moritz). However, this clause is not directly subordinate to the main clause *so fühle ich* but it is secondary subordinate to the *Ziel* complement clause *daß mir dieses genug ist*. 

Notwithstanding these inaccuracies, Moritz' analysis shows a clear understanding of subordinate clauses having simultaneously an internal functional structure and, as a whole clause, having a function inside a superordinate structure. Anachronistically interpreting this as a constituency analysis, this sentence can be displayed as shown in [@fig:moritz1782_300_tree]. Note that this is somewhat akin to an "underlying" structure as the ordering does not correspond to the original sentence. Moritz consistently applies the same functional structure on each clause (viz. the ordering *Grund-Rede-Ziel-Zweck-Hinanfügung*). The numbering in this example indicates the eventual ordering in the resulting sentence.

::: {.tree #moritz1782_300_tree}

:::

Summarising, Moritz appears to have a clear understanding of, first, phrases as the basis of syntactic analysis. Second, he assigns a syntactic function to each phrase. Third, his examples indicate a basic, through rather implicit, understanding of adjuncts as less crucial phrases (*Hinanfügung*) that are visually displayed below the main constituents. Fourth, subordinate clauses have their own clausal structure, while the subordinate as a whole is assigned a function in the superordinate clause, which is a clear precursor of constituency structure. Finally, in the text he explicitly mentions that the ordering of the elements in the actual sentence is slightly different from the ordering in his analyses, and he hints at rules that determine how the abstract "underlying" structure has to be reordered into the actual form.

All these theoretical concepts are quite charmingly summarised by his graphical display, which can be interpreted as a kind of precursor of a constituency structure. Apparently appearing completely out of the blue, the idea of using graphics to elucidate grammatical structure is off to a great start with these proposals from Moritz' *Deutsche Sprachlehre*. Unfortunately, his approach does not have had any following and it would take almost 50 years for graphical methods to be used again for grammatical analysis, namely by Diesterweg in 1830 (see [@sec:diesterweg1830]).

### Herling (1823) *Periodenbau der deutschen Sprache* {#sec:herling1823}

Simon Heinrich Adolf Herling (1780-1849) was a teacher in Frankfurt am Main and founding member, and later main organiser, of the *Frankfurter Gelehrtenverein für deutsche Sprache*. His analysis of multi-clause sentences is widely considered foundational for the grammatical analysis of German. A wide-ranging appraisal of Herling's work can be found in Elmentaler [-@elmentaler1996]. Herling is a close friend and colleague to Ferdinand Becker (see [@sec:becker1829]), who is also an active member of the *Frankfurter Gelehrtenverein*. A plan to write a joint grammar fell apart, indicating different opinions in their approach to grammatical analysis [@haselbach1966: 69]. Their relation remains amicable, as indicated by the fact that the first part of Herling's *Syntax der deutschen Sprache* [@herling1830] is dedicated to Becker.

Strictly speaking, the work of Herling does not include any graphical display of grammatical analysis. However, his work is still included here because he introduces some notation that will be expanded upon graphically by later authors, especially Lehmann (see [@sec:lehmann1833]) and Götzinger (see [@sec:götzinger1836]). Herling's notational framework is first introduced in the *Grundregeln des deutschen Stils oder der Periodenbau der deutschen Sprache. Ein Lehrbuch für den stilistischen Unterricht* [@herling1823], which later becomes the second part of *Die Syntax der deutschen Sprache* (second edition 1827, third edition 1832).

In his book Herling analyses the different ways a *Periode* is constructed from multiple clauses. In a short note inserted in small font inside the main text, Herling proposes a special notation *um die Umformungen kürzer zu bezeichnen, und so leichter überschauen zu können* 'to succinctly mark the transformations and thus be able to survey them more easily' [@herling1823: 177]. The usage of the term *Umformung* deserves it's own discussion, which will not be pursued here. The special notation is summarised slightly clearer in the second and third edition [e.g. @herling1832: 232, see also 177]. The version from the third edition is shown here in the [@fig:herling1832_232], which can be translated as follows:

> For the succinct marking of the sentences and their syntactic relationships may the following symbols be of use: *h* indicates grammatical main sentence; *b* adjective clause, *β*, when it is shortened; *a* adverbial clause, *α*, the same shortened; *s* nominal clause, *σ* the same shortened. The exponents, e.g. *a^2^* indicate the grammatical grade, to *h* e.g. *h^2^* the grade of the logical gradation; *h/2*, *h/3*, indicates that the main clause, or *a/2*, *a/3* that the adverbial clause is separated into two or three parts. The coefficients e.g. *2h* indicate the number of equivalent main clauses; with *a*, *b*, *s* their relationship to the main clauses, often their coordination. [@herling1832: 232]

::: {.im #herling1832_232}
Notation of Herling [-@herling1832: 232] for the analysis of subordinate clauses in complex sentence structure. The different letters have a grammatical meaning, with *h* for main clauses, *b* for relative clauses, *a* for adverbial clauses and *s* for nominal clauses. Superscript numbers are used for the depth of the embedding.
:::

Herling does not use his notations consistently throughout his book. There are only a few incidental examples and there are almost no sentences completely marked according to his system. The example in [@next] is one of the more interesting and complex cases [@herling1832: 233]. Yet, in contrast to intended purpose, the abstract analysis with letters and numbers, interspersed inside the sentence, does not really ease the quick appraisal of the sentence structure, in my opinion.

::: {.ex #herling1823_233}

[@herling1832: 233]
:::

Anachronistically interpreting Herling's analysis in modern terms, his symbols can be seen as a constituency structure. All clauses in the complex sentence are given a label and are related to each other in a hierarchical fashion, distinguishing coordination (viz. number in front) from subordination (viz. special letters for different kinds of embedding and superscript numbers to indicate deeper levels of embedding). Crucially, the clauses are linked to each other without using specific words as anchor points, like they would be in a dependency structure (cf. Becker's sentence analysis of a complex sentence, see [@sec:becker1829]). [@fig:herling1832_233_tree] shows an interpretation of Herling's analysis from [@last] in the form of a constituency tree.

::: {.tree #herling1832_233_tree}
Constituency tree illustrating Herling's analysis [@herling1832: 233] of the example in [@last] using a modern visualization. Crucially, the clauses are linked to each other without attaching them to any specific words as would be the case in a dependency structure.
:::

The analysis of the complex sentence remains a topic of Herling's subsequent work. Noteworthy in the current context is a note to the teachers at the end of the *Erster Cursus eines wissenschaftlichen Unterrichtes in der deutschen Sprache für Deutsche, nach einer neuen auf die Bildungsgesetze der Sprachen gegründeten Methode* [@herling1828]. This book does not have any graphics in the main text. However, completely at the end, in the Appendix *Bemerkungen und Erläuterungen für den Lehrer* [@herling1828: 311-367], he mentions the symbolic analysis using letters as discussed above [@herling1828: 365-366]. And then, as a cherry on top, he proposes to use the well-known graphical display of musical notation to illustrate the structure of complex sentences, as shown in [@fig:herling1828_366]. Herling does not seem to have taken this idea further, only Diesterweg did (see [@sec:diesterweg1830]). Unfortunately, this innovative proposal appears to have disappeared after that.

The example in [@fig:herling1828_366] consists of two paragraphs, a "good" and a "faulty" example. The good example [@next] is from the philosopher Johann Jakob Engel. It consists of five sentences, which are indicated in the notation by the (vertical) musical bar lines. The main clauses (*h*) are basically placed on the middle line, though some are on higher lines. It is not completely clear from the text how exactly this difference in "height" is determined. Subordinate clauses are written below the main clauses, depending on the depth of the embedding. There is a curious addition of "speed" in the graphical display, as indicated by the quarter and sixteenth notes. It seems to be used for stretches of parallel clauses.

### Götzinger (1827) *Deutsche Sprachlehre* {#sec:götzinger1827}

Maximilian Wilhelm Götzinger (1799–1856) was a teacher of German, most of his life working in Schaffhausen (Switzerland). He wrote extensively about grammar, literature and dialectology, see Olsson [-@olsson2009] for an comprehensive appraisal of his work. Besides his didactic writings, Götzinger also provided material for Grimm's dictionary project [@olsson2009: 37] and he was even awarded a doctorate *honoris causa* from the University of Basel in 1838 [@olsson2009: 36], probably through his personal contact with Wilhelm Wackernagel (the father of Jacob Wackernagel of *Wackernagel's law*-fame).

Götzinger wrote two didactic grammatical textbooks, both of which appeared in many different editions throughout the 19th Century [see @olsson2009: 42-46 for a list of all editions]. The book *Die Anfangsgründe der deutschen Sprachlehre in Regeln und Aufgaben* was first published in Leipzig in 1825. This was followed in quick succession by the *Deutsche Sprachlehre für Schulen*, first published in 1827 in Aarau. He also wrote a much more interesting book in 1836, which will be discussed separately (see [@sec:götzinger1836]).

There is a curious graphic in the first edition of the *Deutsche Sprachlehre für Schulen* [@gotzinger1827: 263], reproduced here in [@fig:götzinger1827_263] from the second edition because of the higher quality of the scan [@gotzinger1830: 263]. The graphic indicates the *Hebung* 'raising' and *Senkung* 'lowering' of the voice at the various *Glieder* of a *Periode*, so this is not a graphical display of syntactic structure. For example, the example sentence in [@next] illustrates the option *Viergliedrig*, in this case probably intended to show a case with three rising *Glieder* and a final falling one.

::: ex
Wo göttliche Kraft und Empfindung die Gedanken belebt; wo Dank und Bitte auf den Flügeln des Wortes zum Himmel steigt; wo ein heiliger Ort den umherschweifenden Sinn feßelt und sammelt – da ist Religion. [@gotzinger1827: 264, citing an example from Köppen]

::: {.im #götzinger1827_263}
Götzinger's early attempt to list different kinds of sentence combinations inside a *Periode* [@gotzinger1827: 263]. The *Periode* consists of multiple *Glieder* that can have a rising or falling intonation, as indicated by the lines. By the fact that all possible structures always have a single rising part and a single falling part, Götzinger implies that each *Periode* should always have a single central maximum.
:::

### Schmitthenner (1828) *Teutonia* {#sec:schmitthenner1828}

Friedrich Jakob Schmitthenner (1796-1850) was school director and later professor for history and organisation of state at the university of Gießen. He also wrote various books about German grammar and was part of the *Frankfurtischer Gelehrtenverein für deutsche Sprache*, alongside Herling ([@sec:herling1823]) and Becker ([@sec:becker1829]).

In his 1828 book *Teutonia. Ausführliche Sprachlehre nach neuer wissenschaftlicher Begründung. II. Buch. Höhere Sprachlehre* Schmitthenner includes a graphic for the *Periode* ([@fig:schmitthenner1828_186]). This graphic is very similar to Götzinger's graphic (see [@sec:götzinger1827]), though it is unclear whether there is any direct influence. Like Götzinger, Schmitthenner explains that in his graphic the up and down strokes are supposed to indicate rising (*Hebung*) and falling (*Senkung*) intonation, and not syntactic structure. [@schmitthenner1828: 185]

::: {.im #schmitthenner1828_186}
Intonation contours for multi-clause extended sentences, the so-called *Periode* [@schmitthenner1828: 186]. According to Schmitthenner, a *Periode* consists of multiple *Glieder*, the *Glieder* consist of *Abschnitte*, and each *Abschnitt* seems to be an individual sentence. The lines in the graphic indicate *Abschnitte* (with rising or falling intonation), the *Glieder* are separated by colons or semicolons. For example, the last example has six *Abschnitte* and four *Glieder*. Differently from Götzinger in [@fig:götzinger1827_263], for Schmitthenner a *Periode* can have multiple intonation maxima. It remains unclear from the text whether there is an intended difference between slanted and vertical lines.

### Becker (1829) *Deutsche Grammatik* {#sec:becker1829}

Karl Ferdinand Becker (1775-1849) was probably one of the most influential grammatical educators from the start of the 19th Century. He originally started out as a medical doctor, but that turned out not be a financial success. Instead, he opened a small private school in Offenbach teaching German to English-speaking students. Turning his attention to linguistics, he wrote various books about German grammar. For a thorough repraisal of Becker's linguistic work, see Haselbach [-@haselbach1966]. Becker also became a member of the *Frankfurter Gelehrtenverein für deutsche Sprache*, where he met Herling (see [@sec:herling1823]) and Schmitthenner (see [@sec:schmitthenner1828]).

In his *Organism der Sprache als Einleitung zur deutschen Grammatik* [@becker1827] Becker presents a clear plan for analysis of syntactic relationships inside the sentence (which he called *Satzverhältnisse*), and it is easily possible to anachronistically depict these ideas graphically [e.g. @haselbach1966: 156-161]. However, Becker himself never produced any graphical display of the analysis of a specific sentence, but he came very close with a tabular method of analysis. He originaly introduced a few examples of his tabular method in the preface of the *Deutsche Grammatik* [@becker1829]. Here he presents a few examples of how sentences should be analysed, calling the process *Analyse der Sätze* [@becker1829: xvi-xix]. This explanation is addressed to teachers, instructing them how students should approach the analysis of a sentence. Astonishingly, he never describes this analytical approach in the grammar itself. He returns to this approach in a short book *Über die Methode des Unterrichtes in der deutschen Sprache*, again directed to teachers [@becker1833a: 36-46]. In this book he calls the process *Zergliederung* 'dissection'.

Becker's basic idea is to use a table with all words of the sentence listed as the rows of a table. This approach feels completely natural in the English grammatical tradition of "parsing", which he might have encountered while teaching English-speaking students. In the English grammatical tradition, parsing has a long history. The English word itself originates from the Latin *pars orationis*, i.e. originally parsing is the process to assign parts of speech to individual words. The Oxford English Dictionary lists examples of this usage all the way back to the 16th Century. However, the process of consistently going through a sentence, listing all words separately, and analysing each one individually, seems to have been first used by John Brinsly the Elder in his *Ludus Literarius* from 1612 [nice examples in @brinsley1612: 102, 130]. In the centuries since, this approach to parsing became a mainstay in the English grammatical tradition [@lyman1922: 120-122]. Curiously, this approach to sentence analysis seems to have been basically unknown outside of the English-speaking grammatical tradition.

An example of Becker's table is shown in [@fig:becker1829_xvii], analysing the example sentence in [@next]. The crucial innovation of Becker is the addition of numbers to each row of the table, an approach never before, and never since, used in the English tradition. Becker uses these numbers to clarify the relationships between the words, as for each word he adds the number to the word it modifies at the end of each row in the table. An intriguing detail is that the predicate is linked towards the subject, suggesting that the predicate is modifying the subject. This is in line with the following statement of Becker: "Das Subjekt als derjenige Faktor, auf den das Prädikat bezogen ist" [@becker1829: 290], but at odds with other quotations, like: "… den Begriff des Subjektes, der dem Hauptbegriffe untergeordnet ist, …" [@becker1831: 15].

Another aspect stressed by Becker is that the analysis has two parts: the *Wortform* ("parts of speech") and the *grammatische Bedeutung* ("grammatical meaning"). This twofold analysis might very well be inspired by the highly influential English grammar of Murray, who likewise distinguishes two different kinds of parsing: "[parsing] should be divided into two parts: viz. parsing, as it respects etymology alone; and parsing, as it respects both etymology and syntax" [@murray1824: 195].

> Auch darf die Analyse sich nicht darauf beschränken, etwa nur die Wortarten zu unterscheiden: sie muß bei jedem Gliede des Satzes seine grammatische Bedeutung und die besondere Art der Beziehung bezeichnen, durch welche es mit dem Satze verbunden ist. [@becker1829: xvi]
>
> ('The analysis should not be restricted to distinguish the parts of speech: it has to indicate for each part of the sentence its grammatical meaning and the special kind of relationship, with which it is connected to the sentence.')

The crucial innovation of this "parsing" table is the addition of line-numbers at the start of each row, which allows for a reference to the head of each row (given at the end of each row after *zu*). This format is almost completely identical to the CoNNL-U format for dependency trees, which is widely used today, almost 200 years later. A dependency tree for this table is shown in [@fig:becker1829_xvii_tree].
:::

The format of the table is actually almost completely identical to the contemporary CoNLL-U table-format^[<https://universaldependencies.org/format.html>] for dependency trees. In that format all words are listed in a tab-delimeted file, with minimally five columns: (i) a numerical ID, (ii) the linguistic element, (iii) the word class, (iv) the relation to the head, and (v) the number of the row of the head it modifies. The resulting dependency tree is shown in [@fig:becker1829_xvii_tree]. The file to reproduce this tree is linked at the end of the caption, and is almost verbatim the table from Becker's book of 1829.

This dependency tree is generated by using the CoNLL-U format (code linked at the end), which is almost a verbatim copy of the tabular analysis by Becker. Note that in this analysis, the subject is head of the verb, while the verb is the head of the other elemenst in the sentence.
:::

A more extensive description of this tabular method is given in Becker [-@becker1833a: 38-46], now using the Term *Zergliederung* 'dissection'. From the exposition in that book the impression arises that Becker considered this kind of analysis the basis of all grammatical education. He stresses how important it is to practice the *Zergliederung* with students, and that all other aspects of the grammar can be better explained and understood when they are able to perform such a *Zergliederung*. Given this perspective, it remains completely unclear why this method is only presented in texts adressed to the teachers, and never explained to the students in the actual grammar books.

An example of such a *Zergliederung* from Becker [-@becker1833a: 43] is presented in [@fig:becker1833_43] for the sentence in [@next]. This example is interesting because it contains various subordinated clauses. Becker's method is easily extended to deal with such complex sentences. I leave it as an exercise for the reader to turn this table into the CoNLL-U format and generate a dependency tree.

In summary, the grammatical writings of Becker have had a lot of influence in the 19th Century, but his very practical idea of a numbered tabular analysis has unfortunately not been widely acknowledged. Diesterweg used it, but his proposals also did not have a large impact (see [@sec:diesterweg1830]). Likewise Fürg adopted it (see [@sec:fürg1847]), but that was the last time this method seem to have appeared in the literature. Still, Becker did have an influence on the graphical grammatical practice in Great Brittain, but in a slightly different way (see [@sec:becker1830]).

### Diesterweg (1830) *Praktischer Lehrgang für den Unterricht*  {#sec:diesterweg1830}

Friedrich *Adolph* Wilhelm Diesterweg (1790-1866) was a teacher and a prolific author of textbooks. He also wrote extensively about didactic methods in general, strongly influenced by the ideas of Pestalozzi. Later in life he was politically active in an attempt to reform the Prussian educational system. His practical textbooks mainly dealt with mathematics and German linguistics. A comprehensive analysis of his linguistic work can be found in Czoska [-@czoska1984]. His linguistic proposals did not have much influence on the further development of syntactic analysis, which is unfortunate, because there are a lot of useful insights hidden there.

The *Praktischer Lehrgang für den Unterricht in der deutschen Sprache* is a massive three-volume guide for teachers. As it says in the subtitle, it is *ein Leitfaden für Lehrer, welche die Muttersprache naturgemäß lehren wollen* ('a guide for teachers who want to teach the mother tongue in a natural way'). In the current context I will concentrate on the second volume *Die Wortformen und die Satzlehre*. This second volume first appeared in 1830 [@diesterweg1830], but there have been some important changes in the second edition from 1834 [@diesterweg1834]. The third edition from 1838 [@diesterweg1838] and the fourth from 1847 only saw minor changes. I will cite the 1830 and 1834 version where appropriate, but often include references to the 1838 version as well, as this is the highest-quality openly available digital version. For that reasons I have also used the 1838 for the images included here, as they do not change from the 1830 or 1834 versions.

In the preface to the second edition from 1834, Diesterweg calls his approach *Elementarmethode* 'elementary method' (a clear nod to Pestalozzi), in opposition to the *wissenschaftliche oder die constructive Methode* 'scientific or constructive method' [@diesterweg1834: xii-xiii]. As examples of the scientific method he explicitly cites Herling, Becker, Götzinger and Schmitthenner, all of which he deems inappropriate for secondary education. However, the subsequent proposals Diesterweg makes in his book are all clearly inspired by these authors.

In the first edition from 1830, Diesterweg includes a graphical represenation of the intonation contour of a *Periode*, following Götzinger ([@sec:götzinger1827]) and Schmitthenner ([@sec:schmitthenner1828]), shown here in [@fig:diesterweg1838_169] [@diesterweg1830: 191], shown here in the version from the third edition [@diesterweg1838: 169]. Diesterweg proposes a consistent uses of punctuation marks, with semicolons for sequences of *Beiordung* and colons for the main intonation maximum. With this analysis, Diesterweg follows the approach from Götzinger that each *Periode* has a single maximum.

::: {.im #diesterweg1838_169}
The rhythmical structure of the *Periode* [@diesterweg1830: 191; @diesterweg1838: 169], clearly inspired by Götzinger and Schmitthenner. The structure is actually closest to Götzinger as shown in [@fig:götzinger1827_263], because for Diesterweg each *Periode* only has a single intonation maximum, which is indicated by the colon between two slanted lines. The semicolons are always linking a *Beiordnung* and were originally accompanied by a horizontal line [@diesterweg1830: 191]. When the horizontal lines were removed in later editions [e.g. @diesterweg1838: 169 shown here], the same structure as found in Götzinger [-@gotzinger1827: 263] is obtained.
:::

In the 1830 edition Diesterweg also proposes a notation for subordinated clauses (using a raised star: *) and coordinated clauses (using a the typographic dagger: †). Deeper embedded clauses are marked by repeating these symbols [@diesterweg1830: 188-190]. These symbols are placed at the start of each clause, resulting in examples like [@next], somewhat reminiscent of the use of letters in [@herling1823_233] by Herling.

[@diesterweg1830: 189]
:::

In the 1834 edition Diesterweg replaces these symbolic visualisations with letter sequences based on the proposals by Herling (see [@sec:herling1823]) and Lehmann (see [@sec:lehmann1833]). He introduces capital letters for main clauses and lower-case letters for subordinate clauses like Lehmann [-@lehmann1833] using the superscript numbers for 'deeper' subordinations like Herling Herling [-@herling1823]. However, Diesterweg ignores the meaning of the different letters as proposed by Herling, similar to Lehmann [-@lehmann1833]. Also, he ignores Lehmann's use of horizontal braces, replacing them with simple commas. The resulting sequence of letters is called *Satzbild* by Diesterweg [-@diesterweg1834: 162-163, 170], which is the first occurence of this term. However, at another page he uses the term *Periodenbild* with the same meaning [@diesterweg1834: 168-169]. This term was first used by Lehmann [-@lehmann1833].

Additionally, Diesterweg combines the letter sequences with the graphical representation of the intonation contour [@diesterweg1834: 162-163; @diesterweg1838: 164-165]. And as an alternative representation, Diesterweg also proposes to use the music-score diagram from Herling [-@herling1828]. Both visualisations are shown in [@fig:diesterweg1834_169] [@diesterweg1834: 169; @diesterweg1838: 171] illustrating the example sentence in [@next]. Just like Diesterweg, I leave it as an exercise to the reader to follow along with the analysis in the figure.

The visualisation is based on proposals from Herling ([@sec:herling1823]) and Lehmann ([@sec:lehmann1833]). First, the intonation contour (on top) is further specified by letter sequences (called *Satzbild* or *Periodenbild* by Diesterweg), which are a blend of the abbreviations used by Herling [-@herling1823] and Lehmann [-@lehmann1833]. Second, as an alternative display, Diesterweg uses the music score approach similar to the proposal by Herling [-@herling1828].
:::

But Diesterweg is not yet finished. He also proposes a syntactic analysis based on the ideas of Becker (see [@sec:becker1829]). Diesterweg uses an intricate graphical analysis of clause internal structure for *ausgebildete Sätze*, as shown in [@fig:diesterweg1830_174] [@diesterweg1830: 174, 266; @diesterweg1838: 158, 260]. He uses the distinction between *nackte* 'naked' and *ausgebildete* 'developed' sentences here, which was widespread at the time. The question about the internal structure of a sentence only arises with *ausgebildete* 'developed' sentences, i.e. with sentences that have additional material other than a bare subject and predicate. In the figure, the 'naked' sentence, consisting of a bare subject and predicate, is put on top and the 'development' is added below.

Diesterweg uses braces, both horizontal and vertical, to indicate groups of words in developed sentences. It is tempting to compare this graphical approach using braces with the analysis of Moritz (see [@sec:moritz1782]). However, there is no indication that there has been any direct influence of Moritz on Diesterweg. It seems more plausible that the use of braces is a parallel development, because large braces is simply one of the few graphical tricks that were available for typesetting at the time.

Diesterweg does not employ syntactic diagrams with lines, because he restricts line diagrams to the illustration of ~~hierarchical subdivision~~ of grammatical categories, e.g differentiating kinds of plurals [@diesterweg1838: 8], kinds of nouns [@diesterweg1838: 22-23] or kinds of adjectives [@diesterweg1838: 53], and many more such examples through the book. In contrast, a sentence is not an example of hierarchical subdivision, but an example of ~~hierarchical modification~~, which Diesterweg calls *Bestimmung*. It seems plausible that Diesterweg quite consciously avoided the usage of the same visualisation for these two different applications.

The visual analysis with braces, which Diesterweg calls *Zergliederung* and sometimes *Analyse* [following @becker1829: 16] includes various crucial syntactic details. Many of these details are not explained; Diesterweg simply claims that well-taught pupils should be able to follow along with the analysis of the complex sentence [@next] as illustrated with the graphic in [@fig:diesterweg1830_174].

> Sind die Schüler bis hieher [sic] gründlich unterrichtet worden; so müssen sie im Stande sein, den nachfolgenden Satz, wie folgt, zu zergliedern und wieder zusammenzusetzen. [@diesterweg1830: 174; -@diesterweg1838: 158]

Syntactic analysis by diagram of the sentence in [@last] from Diesterweg [-@diesterweg1830: 174; -@diesterweg1838: 158]. The "naked" sentence with only subject and predicate is positioned on top, linked by a dotted line. Horizontal braces indicate modification by other words, with the part below the brace being the *Bestimmer* 'determiner' of the word on top. Vertical braces indicate "constituent" grouping. The single reversed horizontal brace on the mid left also indicates a grouping, possibly considered too large for another set of hierarchically positioned vertical braces.
:::

Diesterweg's visual analysis of [@last], as shown in [@fig:diesterweg1830_174], contains various important syntactic details that have to be inferred from closely inspecting the display:

- The analysis has a subject-predicate basis, as indicated by the dots at the top, linking the subject *Ein Vater* to the predicate *hat sich ausgezeichnet*. This is called the *nackter Satz* by Diesterweg.
- On the predicate side (to the right), the various adverbial modifiers are simply stacked downwards using horizontal braces, with the actual ordering in the sentence being from bottom to top. Notice the difference in size of the braces, which is meaningful. In contrast, the vertical braces on the right side indicate constituent subgrouping.
- On the subject side (to the left), we also see horizontal braces to indicate modification and vertical braces to indicate grouping. The horizontal braces seem to point towards the head they modify, though this positioning is not always completely accurate.
- On the subject side (to the left) there is also a single reversed horizontal brace to indicate modification to the whole first part of the noun phrase up to the head noun *Vater*. It would have been more consistent to use large vertical braces, then the hierarchical structure would have become obvious.
- There are various small negligent errors, both in the image (the word *lebenden* is omitted) and in the explaining text (where the phrase *unter fremden Menschen* is added).

Diesterweg returns to this syntactic analysis at the end of the book [@diesterweg1830: part 3, chapter nine; @diesterweg1834: part 3, chapter ten] under the heading *Die grammatische Zergliederung der Sätze* [@diesterweg1830: 263]. He first repeats the previously used analysis using braces, but then turns his attention to sentences containing (multiple) subordinate clauses. Without any comment he omits the bracketed analysis and turns to a table-style analysis with numbered words and cross-references, exactly like Becker (see [@sec:becker1829]). Diesterweg probably noticed that the bracketed visualisation becomes exceedingly complex and confusing with more elaborated sentences. However, from his seemless switch between bracketed visualisation and numbered tables it becomes clear that these two approaches are interchangeable in his mind. It is just a matter of practical applicability which system to use in a particular example.

Finally, there are two interesting terminological issues addressed by Diesterweg. First, he prefers the term *Ausbildung* over the widespread term *Erweiterung*, which is actually still an extremely common grammatical term in Germany today.

> Man hat die ~~Ausbildung~~ des Satzes auch ~~Erweiterung~~ desselben genannt. Es ist Erweiterung, in so fern mehr Wörter hinzutreten, als der Satz länger wird. Es ist dies eine ~~grammatische~~ Erweiterung. Da aber die näher bestimmten Wörter eine engere Begriffssphäre erhalten, so ist es eine ~~logische~~ Verengerung. Deshalb wird das Wort ~~Erweiterung~~ besser vermieden. [@diesterweg1830: 167; -@diesterweg1834: 151]
>
> ('The ~~development~~ (*Ausbildung*) of a sentence is also called ~~expansion~~ (*Erweiterung*). It is an expansion because more words are added, and the sentence will become longer. So it is a ~~grammatical~~ expansion. However, because the modified words obtain a more narrow meaning, it is a ~~logical~~ narrowing. Therefore, the word ~~expansion~~ (*Erweiterung*) is better avoided.')

Second, throughout the discussion of syntax, Diesterweg frequently uses the nomen agentis *Bestimmer* 'determiner' for a word that modifies another. This appears to be a quite practical term, but unfortunately this terminological quirk has not caught on.

> Die Ausbildung geschieht durch nähere Bestimmung der einzelnen Satztheile. Wir wollen diese Wörter, welche die Hauptsatztheile näher bestimmen, überhaupt ~~Bestimmer~~ nennen. [@diesterweg1830: 167; -@diesterweg1834: 151]
>
> ('The development (*Ausbildung*) happens by modification (*Bestimmung*) of the individual parts of the clause. In general, we will call such words, that further modify parts of the main clause, modifiers (*Bestimmer*).')

In summary, the grammatical analysis of Diesterweg is a complex tour-de-force, combining insights from various scholars of the preceding decade, synthesising everything into a coherent and visually appealing package. Additionally, he attempts to make the grammatical analysis practically useful for application in the classroom. Many ideas proposed in his book feel rather modern and might have kickstarted a fruitful dicussion about syntactic analysis. Unfortunately, Diesterweg's *Lehrgang* does not seem to have had much impact on the further development of linguistics in general, nor specifically on the establishment of linguistic education. From here on, the development of grammatical analysis in Germany will proceed taking baby steps, instead of leaping ahead like Diesterweg demonstrated to be possible.

### Billroth (1832) *Lateinische Syntax* {#sec:billroth1832}

(Note: the first modern author to rediscover Billroth was probably Sandmann [-@sandmann1971: 428] in a book edited by Coseriu, who cited Billroth in [@coseriu1980].)

At the end of his short life, Johann Gustav Willhelm Billroth (1808-1836) became professor for religion at the university in Halle. Before that, between his *Habilitation* in Leipzig in 1830 and the start of his position in Halle in 1834, he worked as a teacher for Latin [@alwast2000]. In that context he wrote two latin grammars for use in schools, first the *Lateinische Syntax für die obern Klassen gelehrter Schulen* [@billroth1832], later followed by the *Lateinische Schulgrammatik für alle Klassen* [@billroth1834].

In these grammars there is a single graphical display of a grammatical structure, shown below in [@fig:billroth1832_102] [@billroth1832: 102; -@billroth1834: 332-333]. Not much is known about the grammatical background of Billroth, nor is there any explicit indication in his books about the inspiration for drawing a grammatical analysis. As he was active as a school teachter, he might very well have been aware of Becker [-@becker1829, see [@sec:becker1829]] or Diesterweg [-@diesterweg1830, see [@sec:diesterweg1830]], both of which might have been an inspiration for Billroth's graphical display. One (circumstantial) argument that Billroth was inspired by Diesterweg is that Billroth uses the term *bestimmter Satz* as a synonym to *bekleideter Satz* [@billroth1832: 97], and he also uses the noun *Bestimmung* in the meaning of "modifier" [@billroth1832: 126-127]. Diesterweg very extensively used the nouns *Bestimmung* and *Bestimmer*, the last one of which is not found in Billroth. It is possible that Billroth just used these words out of his own inspiration, but this parallel usage is idiosyncratic enough to be notewhorthy, as these terms do not seem to be in wide use at this time.

In Billroth's syntax, the whole discussion of the structure of the sentence takes 11 pages [@billroth1832: 91-102]. The structure of the text is rather difficult to follow, although on closer inspection there is a clear, but drawn-out organisation. First, he introduces the simple 'naked' sentence as option *A*:

> Ein Satz ist entweder: A. ein einfacher (oder nackter) d.h. ein solcher, welcher bloß aus Subject, Prädicat und Copula besteht. [@billroth1832: 91] 
> 
> ('A sentence is either: A. a simple (or naked) one i.e. one such that it only consists of subject, predicate and copula.')

It takes 8 pages of explanations of the simple sentence until finally the expected follow-up to the option *A* occurs. Without clear formatting, the option *B* is announced innocuously on page 97, using a rather strange sentence structure that only makes sense when it is read immediately after the option *A* as quoted above.

> B. oder ein bestimmter (bekleideter) d.h. ein solcher, wo entweder ein einzelner Theil oder mehrere durch Zusätze näher bestimmt werden. [@billroth1832: 97]
> 
> ('B. or a determined (dressed) one, i.e. one such, in which either a single part or multiple parts are further determined by additions.')

Then it takes another 5 pages of explanations of different kinds of such "dressed" sentences until finally this topic is closed with the conclusion quoted below. Billroth simply states (without explanation) that the example sentence [@next] is 'dressed' as illustrated by the drawing in [@fig:billroth1832_102]. In this quote, Billroth takes the metaphor of the naked/dressed sentence even one step further by using the term *Körper* 'body' for the naked sentence.

> Auf diese Weise wird z.B. folgender Satz [@next], dessen Körper eigentlich nur aus dem Subj.: *Miltiades* und dem Prädicat (mit dem Copula) *reddidit* besteht, bekleidet: [@billroth1832: 102]
> 
> ('In this way, the following sentence, whose body only consists of the subject *Miltiades* and the predicate (with copula) *reddidit*, is dressed:')

This depiction is rather similar to Diesterweg's approach in [@fig:diesterweg1830_174], but the usage of lines instead of braces is different.
:::

Interpreting his graphical illustration in more detail, the naked sentence is depicted by a horizonal line, while the additional elements of the "dressed" sentence are all shown as vertical/slanted lines. Billroth very clearly intends the vertical lines to represent some kind of dependency, with multiple levels of modification being illustrated by subsequent vertical lines. The structure of the graphic is quite similar to Diesterwegs proposal in [@fig:diesterweg1830_174], but with lines instead of curly braces.

Exactly the same approach with the same picture is found in his extended grammar written two years later [@billroth1834: 332-333]. After Billroth's early death this grammar has seen various new editions. The second edition of 1838 is prepared by Friedrich Ellendt and uses exactly the same figure [@billroth1838: 329]. However, in the third edition, the picture is changed, erroneously, and has become completely incomprehensible, cf. [@fig:billroth1848_358] [@billroth1848: 358]. Ellendt possibly did not completely understand what the figure is supposed to represent.

:::

Billroth's grammar has an interesting afterlife, but unfortunately without any further development of his graphical innovation. Friedrich Ellendt writes a different grammer for younger students based on Billroth's model, called *Lateinische Grammatik für die unteren Klassen der Gymnasien*. The discussion of *bekleidete oder erweitete Sätze* is very similar to Billroth's, but it has different examples and it does not have a picture anymore [@ellendt1838: 115-116]. After the death of Ellendt, that grammar is in turn adapted by Moritz Seyffert as *Dr. Friedrich Ellendt's Lateinische Grammatik für die unteren und mittleren Klassen der höheren Unterrichtsanstalten*. This grammar has seen very many revisions, editions and reprints under the heading *Ellendt-Seyfferts lateinische Grammatik* far into the 20th Century. However, Seyffert was not very impressed by the syntactical analysis of Billroth (as noted in the preface of his revision), and he rewrote the discussion of syntax wholesale.

On a more positive note, Billroth's grammar had a direct influence on Julius Hoffmann (see [@sec:hoffmann1839]), and Hoffmann is quoted indirectly by Franz Kern (see [@sec:kern1883]). So it seems very plausible that Billroth's line diagram was a seed that grew slowly but surely.

### Lehmann (1833) *Allgemeiner Mechanismus des Periodenbaues* {#sec:lehmann1833}

Johann August Otto Leopold Lehmann (1802-1883) worked as a teacher in Danzig (Gdańsk) and later as a school principal in Marienwerder (Kwidzyn). In this context, he prepared various educational textbooks, mainly consisting of literary commentaries, but also including songbooks, dialect analyses and some works on local history. Early in his career he wrote a linguistic treatise about the structure of the complex sentence: *Allgemeiner Mechanismus des Periodenbaues, nebst einem Versuche, an ihn eine Kritik der deutschen Periode anzuknüpfen* [@lehmann1833]. His approach to the analysis of complex sentences is based on the work of Herling (see [@sec:herling1823]), who is explicitly cited as a source of inspiration [@lehmann1833: xv-xvi]. 

In the title of his book, Lehmann uses the term *Periode*, which is a term also used by Herling. This term stems from the domain of rhetoric and roughly indicates a coherent and well-structured utterance. Continuing the tradition of Herling, Lehmann uses the term *Periode* to designate a complex sentence that consists of multiple clauses. Herling introduced symbolic abbreviations for different kinds of clauses (see [@sec:herling1823]), but Lehmann takes this a step further and proposes a comprehensive visualization of the structure of a complex sentence, which he calls a *Periodenbild*.

> [Die] innere Anschauung der Periode soll als auf äußere Anschauung begründet dargestellt werden. Die äußere Anschauung aber findet ihr Objekt in Bildern, welche das Skelet der Perioden wiedergeben. Ich nenne dies Periodenskelet ~~Anschauungsbild der Periode~~ oder ~~Periodenbild~~ schlechtweg. [@lehmann1833: xiv]
> 
> ('The internal structure of the *Periode* will be depicted based on the outward appearance. The outward appearance shows itself as a picture, which reflects the skeleton of the *Periode*. I simply call this *Periode*-skeleton an image of the *Periode* or a *Periodenbild*.') 

For the visualization of a *Periodenbild* Lehmann distinguishes three different kinds of subordination, indicated by different symbolic devices as shown in [@fig:lehmann1833_58] [@lehmann1833: 58]. These three notations basically indicate a subordinate position after (1), before (2) and internal (3) to the superordinate clause, respectively. More precisely, 

- the first notation uses a horizontal brace, which indicates that the subordinate clause (below the brace) follows the superordinate clause (above the brace). This is called *Anfügung* or *Nachperiode*;
- the second notation uses a colon, which indicates that the subordinate clause (in front of the colon) is positioned before the main clause. This is called *Vordersatz*, *Vorderperiode* or *Vorausschickung*;
- the third notation uses round brackets, which indicates that the subordinate clause (inside the brackets) is positioned inside the superordinate clause. This is called an *Einschaltung*. The separated parts of the superordinate clause are indicated by repeating the same letter. Such repetitions of the same letter thus do not indicate multiple clauses, but separate parts of the same clause.

::: {.im #lehmann1833_58}
Three basic structural mechanisms of subordination from Lehmann [-@lehmann1833: 58]. The first (with a horizontal brace) indicated that the subordination follows the main clause; the second (with a colon) indicates that the subordination precedes the main clause; and the third (with round brackets) indicated that the subordination is positioned internal to the main clause.
:::

At first glance it seems curious that there are completely different notation for the placement in front (colon) and the placement behind (horizontal brace). However, there is clear rationale for this difference arising from the structural possibilities of the German language (although this rationale is not explained by Lehmann in his book). The German main clause has a special initial position (today mostly called *Vorfeld*) that can contain a single subordinate clause. So each main clause can only have a single *Vordersatz*, which Lehmann indicates with the colon. Internal and final subordination can be recursively repeated.

Lehmann's book completely focusses on the analysis of complex sentences into their constituting clauses, using his graphical display to summarize the relationships between the clauses. There are hundreds of examples of different kinds of complex sentences discussed in his book, but there is not a single analysis of a clause-internal structure at all. He appears to be much more interested in the number of possible schemas that could exist, which are all *Umformungen* of a complex sentence. For example, he discusses an example of a particular schematic analysis (apparently without any real linguistic sentence in mind) that could theoretically have 37,632 *Umformungen* [@lehmann1833: 116-118]. Lehmann immediately notes *"Es wäre thöricht, bei dieser oder ähnlichen Perioden, die zu den Verwickeltsten gehören, all möglichen Veränderungen darzustellen."* ['It would be foolish for such or similar *Perioden*, that belong to the most complex ones, to illustrate all possible changes.' @lehmann1833: 116-118].

Clauses are indicated by using letters, an approach that was also used by Herling (cf. [@sec:herling1823]). However, Lehmann has a completely different approach to the use of the letters. Lehmann is only interested in the relative ordering of the subordinated clauses and he completely ignores what kind of subordination is used. In contrast, Herling uses different letters for different grammatical kinds of subordinated clauses, for example *a* for adverbial clauses. When there are three adverbial clauses in a sentence, then they are all called *a* by Herling. The letters are thus indications of the grammatical kind of the clause. Lehmann instead uses a different letter for each subordinate clause, giving each clause an individual label, but omitting any indication of the internal structure.

This difference between Herling and Lehmann also concerns the use of Greek letters. Herling uses greek letters for non-finite subordinate clauses (using *zu*-infinitive or participial verb forms in German), but Lehmann does not consider non-finite clauses at all. He uses greek letters for doubly-embedded subordinate clauses. In contrast, Herling uses numerical superscripts for multiple grades of embedding. Lehmann uses different kinds of scripts to distinguish multiple grades of embedding. He uses capital letters for main clauses, lower-case letters for subordinate clauses and greek letters for doubly-embedded clauses. Third-grade embedding uses Fraktur capital letters (e.g. 𝔄, 𝔅) and fourth-grade embedding uses Fraktur lower-case letter (e.g. 𝔞, 𝔟). There is even a short discussion of a fifth-grade embedding, which is indicated with numerals [@lehmann1833: 232].

In contrast to Herling, Lehmann's approach thus ignores many apects of the grammatical analysis of a sentence. However, his focus on the relation between clauses allows him in return to tackle really complex sentences. Consider, for example, the long and complex sentence in [@next], which is a sentence from Immanuel Kant's *Anthropologie in pragmatischer Hinsicht* [@lehmann1833: 125-126]. The internal structure of this sentence is summarized by Lehmann with a relatively simple *Periodenbild* as shown in [@fig:lehmann1833_126].

Lehmann's [-@lehmann1833: 126] analysis of Kant's sentence [@last]. The main clause is designated with a capital letter *A*, which is interrupted twice by subordinated clauses designated by lower-case letters, *b* and *c*. A further subordinated clause *a* comes before the main clause, and is itself interrupted by a second-order subordination designated by greek letter *α*. After the main clause there is yet another subordinated clause *d*, which is followed by a secondary embedding *β*, which is interrupted by a tertiary embedding indicated by a Fraktur capital letter *𝔄*.
:::

The different clauses in [@fig:lehmann1833_126] are listed below, exactly as it is explained in the text by Lehmann:

- **main clause A:** [clause *a* preceding] *diese Liebenswürdigkeit des Geschöpfs im Zeitraum seiner Entwicklung zur Menschheit, muß wohl auf Rechnung seiner Unschuld und Offenheit aller seiner noch fehlerhaften Aeußerungen* [clause *b* internal] *einerseits, andrerseits aber auf den natürlichen Hang der Ammen zum Wohlthun an einem Geschöpf* [clause *c* internal] *geschrieben werden* [clause *d* following]
- **subordinate clause *a*, preceding *A*:** *daß ferner* [clause *α* internal] *das Radbrechen der Wörter es für Mütter und Ammen so liebenswürdig macht es beständig zu herzen und zu küssen und Willens zum kleinen Befehlshaber zu verziehen*
- **subordinate clause *b*, internal to *A*:** *wobei noch kein Hehl und nichts Arges ist*
- **subordinate clause *c*, internal to *A*:** *welches einschmeichelnd sich der Willkür eines andern überläßt*
- **subordinate clause *d*, following *A*:** *da ihm eine Spielzeit eingewilligt wird, die glücklichste unter allen* [clause *β* following]

- **secondary subordinate clause *β*, following *d*:** *wobei der Erzieher dadurch* [clause *𝔄* internal] *diese Annehmlichkeit nochmals genießt*
- **tertiary subordinate clause *𝔄*, internal to *β*:** *daß er sich selber gleichsam zum Kinde macht*

Although Lehmann's book does not appear to have been reprinted after the first edition from 1833, it has influenced later more widely read works by Götzinger (see [@sec:götzinger1836]) and Bauer (see [@sec:bauer1850]), whose graphical displays will be reprinted up to 1935. Götzinger's acknowledgement indicates that Lehmann's approach might have had some real influence in didactic circles, although it has not endured to the present day:

> *Die von Herrn Director Lehmann in Marienwerden zuerst aufgestellten Periodenbilder haben bei vielen Schulmännern Beifall und Anwendung gefunden, und es macht mir große Freude, durch meine Lehrbücher zur Verbreitung dieser Methode, deren Verdienst ganz allein Herrn Lehmann gebührt, beigetragen zu haben.* [@gotzinger1842: x, Vorrede zur fünften Auflage]
>
> ('The *Periodenbilder*, first drawn by director Lehmann from Marienwerder, have been praised and employed by many Schoolmen, and I am delighted through my textbooks to have contributed to the wider circulation of this method, the credit to which completely befits Mr. Lehmann.')

Lehmann himself remained active and used his system in various later publications. First, he used it in *Goethe's Sprache und ihr Geist* [@lehmann1852: 152-180] to analyse sentences by Goethe, which includes very complex examples of his notation. Surprisingly, Lehmann is regularly quite critical of Goethe and uses his notation to argue for the imbalanced sentence structure, for example [@next] as analysed in [@fig:lehmann1852_171].

> Schon das Bilde dieser Periode zeigt deren Uebelstände. Erstlich die große Masse der Sätze, zweitens der Mangel an Ebenmaß theils zwischen den koordinirten Hauptsätzen theils zwischen den koordinirten Nebensätzen, drittens die Vorherrschaft des Anfügungsgesetzes. [@lehmann1852: 171-172]

:::

Later Lehmann wrote *Sprachliche Studien über das Nibelungenlied* [@lehmann1856; @lehmann1857] in which he again uses his system to analyse classical German literature. In the introduction he cites Nägelsbach [@lehmann1856: 4] and Götzinger [@lehmann1856: 7] and follows Nägelsbach simplification (see [@sec:nägelsbach1846]) to use a comma instead of the horizontal brace [@lehmann1857: 8]. With this simplification is becomes possible to write *Periodenbilder* inside the normal text of a book, because the *Periodenbild* is just a linear line of characters.

Finally, Lehmann wrote a literary analysis *Forschungen über Lessings Sprache* [@lehmann1875]. In this book he again used his *Periodenbilder*, but just as one of the possible ways to elucidate structures in the literary oevre of Lessing [@lehmann1875: 130-149]. Interestingly, he ignores the simplification he used in his previous word and reverts back to his original notation from 1833.

Lehmann's examples of the application of the scheme to actual literary texts inspired many philological analyses in the decades to come. For example, via the *Repetitorium* of Menge (see [@sec:menge1873]) there is a direct line to the 1969 dissertation on the *Amadisroman* from Langholf (see [@sec:langholf1969]) using similar graphical analyses as Lehmann, more than a century after the original proposals.

## The many guises of linguistic *Bilder*

### Götzinger (1836) *Die deutsche Sprache* {#sec:götzinger1836}

Maximilian Wilhelm Götzinger (1799–1856) was a teacher of German, most of his life working in Schaffhausen (Switzerland). He wrote extensively about grammar, literature and dialectology, see Olsson [-@olsson2009] for an comprehensive appraisal of his work. Besides his didactic writings, Götzinger also provided material for Grimm's dictionary project [@olsson2009: 37] and he was even awarded a doctorate *honoris causa* from the University of Basel in 1838 [@olsson2009: 36], probably through his personal contact with Wilhelm Wackernagel (the father of Jacob Wackernagel of *Wackernagel's law*-fame).

Götzinger's early textbooks were already mentioned in [@sec:götzinger1827], but these early books did not contain any graphical analyses of sentences. But then Götzinger discovered Lehmann's *Periodenbau* [-@lehmann1833] and that changed everything. In 1835 Götzinger wrote a review of Lehmann' book [@gotzinger1835a] and in the third edition of the *Sprachlehre* from 1835 he introduced Lehmann's graphical displays. Götzinger cites the influence of Lehmann in the preface [@gotzinger1835: xiii-xiv] and he applies Lehmann's graphical analysis both to clause structure, under heading *Stellungen der Bekleidung* [@gotzinger1835: 243-248], and to sentence structure, under the heading *Stellung der Nebensätze* [@gotzinger1835: 310-315]. Götzinger distinguishes these two applications of Lehmann's analysis by using different names: *Satzbild* for clause structure and *Periodenbild* for larger sentence structures consisting of multiple clauses [@gotzinger1835: 311].

Contamporaneously to revising this textbook, Götzinger prepared his magnum opus *Die deutsche Sprache und ihre Literatur* [volume one -@gotzinger1836; volume two -@gotzinger1839]. This book also includes many graphical analyses inspired by the *Periodenbilder* from Lehmann (see [@sec:lehmann1833]). In this book, Götzinger does not explicitly cite Lehmann as his inspiration for the graphical display, but he mentions Lehmann's *vortreffliches Buch* ('excellent book') in a different context [@gotzinger1839: 217]. I will use these two volumes of *Die deutsche Sprache* to summarise Götzinger's interpretation of Lehmann's approach.

There are two main differences between Lehmann and Götzinger. First, Götzinger simplifies Lehmann's quite elaborate use of different character set. Lehmann uses latin, greek, and fraktur letters, in upper- and lower-case, with different meanings. Götzinger only uses latin capitals for main clauses and latin lower-case letters for subordinate clauses. Second, Lehmann originally used his graphical method only for main and subordinated clauses (*Periode*), but Götzinger argues that the same principle of subordination (*Unterordnung*) can be used for other kinds of linguistic structure as well. Consequently, Götzinger uses Lehmann's notation also for (i) syllabic structure, (ii) clause-internal structure and (iii) clause subordination.

> Auf diese Weiße ordnet die Sprache bei allen Vorgängen den jedesmaligen Stoff so, daß ein Theil desselben als untergeordnet erscheint, in der Silbe die Laute, im Worte die Silben, im Satze die Worte, in der Periode die Sätze. [@gotzinger1836: 15]
> 
> ('Accordingly, language arranges the particular content in all occurrences in such a way that one part of it appears as subordinated: with syllables the sounds, with words the syllables, with clauses the words, with sentences the clauses.')

First, for the analysis of the syllable, Götzinger [-@gotzinger1836: 221-224] uses the capital letter for the vowel as the centre of the syllable (*Träger und Mittelpunkt der Silbe*) and lower-case letters for the consontants as dependent on the vowel (*erscheint stets als untergeordnet*). As long as the syllabic structure is according to the sonority hierarchy (*musikalisches Gesetz*), it can be described as (multiple) prefixal and suffixal subordinations, as illustrated in [@fig:götzinger1836_223]. Extrasyllabic initial *s* and affricate codas *ps*, *tsch* and *chs* are illustrated with different structures not shown here [@gotzinger1836: 224].

> In der Regel findet bei der Gliederung der Silbe durch fortschreitende Unterordnung der Elemente ein Schwellen und Sinken, ein Steigen und Fallen, ein Crescendo und Decrescendo statt; d.h. die Silbe fängt mit dem lautlosesten Element an, geht zu dem tönenenden über, gelangt zur eigentlichen Stimme, und geht nun denselben Weg wieder abwärts, so daß mithin in jeder auf diese Weiße gebaute Silbe ein völlig musikalisisches Gesetz statt findet. [@gotzinger1836: 222]
> 
> ('Normally, the arrangement of the syllable consists, by repeated subordination of the elements, of swelling and sinking, of rising and falling, of crescendo and decrescendo; i.e. the syllable starts with the most silent element, proceeds to the more sounding one, reaches the principal voice, and then follows the same path downwards again in such a way that each such constructed syllable obeys a completely musical law.')

::: {.im #götzinger1836_223}
Syllables with a structure in accordance to the sonority hierarchy [@gotzinger1836: 223] have a vowel as nucleus (capital letter) and possibly multiple 'subordinate' consonants in the onset (lower-case letters separated horizontally with colons) and the coda (lower-case letters separated vertically with braces).
:::

Second, for the analysis of the internal structure of a clause Götzinger proposes to use the same notation [@gotzinger1839: 159-162], which he calls *Satzbilder* [@gotzinger1839: 161]. A few examples are shown in [@fig:götzinger1839_161]. The capital letter now refers to the verb and the lower-case letters refer to the constituents. Götzinger calls the lower-cased elements *Bekleidung*. Today a German grammar would call them *Satzglied*. The German main clause structure with two verb positions is indicated by a repeated capital letter, called *trennbare Zusammensetzung* by Götzinger [-@gotzinger1839: 160]. Similar terminology can still be found in contemporaneous German grammars.

Relative to the main verb, the three possible positions of the *Bekleidung* (i.e. before, in between and after the verb) are called *Voraussendung, Anfügung, Einschiebung*, respectively [@gotzinger1839: 160]. They are indicated with a colon, a horizontal brace and round brackets in the tradition of Lehmann (see [@sec:lehmann1833]), who calls them *Vorausschickung, Anfügung* and *Einschaltung*. Today a German grammar would say *Vorfeld, Nachfeld* and *Mittelfeld*. Götzinger also observes one of the main generalisation of German main clause structure, namely that the *Voraussendung/Vorfeld* never consists of more than one *Bekleidung/Satzglied*. 

> Mag also die Stellung der Bekleidung in jenem Satze seyn, wie sie will, immer wird nur das Bild entstehen [mit einer Voraussendung]. Niemals kann die Folge vorkommen [mit mehreren Voraussendungen]. [@gotzinger1839: 162]
>
> ('Although the position of the constituents in the sentence can be as it chooses, the resulting image will always have a single *Vorraussendung*. The ordering with multiple *Voraussendungen* cannot occur.')

::: {.im #götzinger1839_161}
Main clause analysis from Götzinger [-@gotzinger1839: 161] using the same notation as for syllables. In modern grammatical terminology: the main verb is indicated by the capital letter, possibly two times in case of a separated verb. Other *Satzglieder* are indicated by lower-case letters. The *Vorfeld* is separated by a colon. The *Mittelfeld* is put between round brackets, with multiple constituents separated by commas. The *Nachfeld* is indicated below the horizontal brace, again with commas separating mulitple constituents.
:::

Third, for the analysis of the multi-clause sentence Götzinger again uses the same notation. He separates the analysis of basic subordination [@gotzinger1839: 364-367] from the analysis of the *Periode* [@gotzinger1839: 374-403]. This distinction is not very clear, as he comments that *der Begriff ~~Periode~~ ist etwas schwankender Natur* 'the concept of the *Periode* has somewhat of a wavering nature'. He introduces the equal sign for coordination [@gotzinger1839: 366]. A slighly complex *Periodenbild* is shown in [@fig:götzinger1839_391] for an example sentence [@next] from Goethe.

::: ex

### Horn (1837) *Grammatik der neuhochdeutschen Sprache* {#sec:horn1837}

Friedrich Julius Horn (1809-1841) was a teacher in Rastenburg (today Kętrzyn in Poland).^[I have not been able to find any biographical details on Horn. The dates for his birth and death are from <https://www.gedbas.de/person/show/1131121830>. Besides his grammar, he also wrote a piece in the yearbook of his school in 1838, which is available online at <https://kpbc.umk.pl/dlibra/publication/246849>.] In 1837 he published a German grammar, called *Grammatik der neuhochdeutschen Sprache auf historischer und logischer Grundlage* [@horn1837]. In the preface he cites Herling (see [@sec:herling1823]), Becker (see [@sec:becker1829]) and Lehmann (see [@sec:lehmann1833]) as influences [@horn1837: iii]. Horn uses a *Periodenbild* exactly following the notation from Lehmann, who is explicitly cited [@horn1837: 217, 312-314]. An example is shown in [@fig:horn1837_313] for the example in [@next].

### Beilhack (1838) *Deutsche Grammatik*

Johann Georg Beilhack (1802-1864) was a teacher and school principal in Munich.^[A succinct biographical sketch is available online at <https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Georg_Beilhack>, accessed 9 May 2025.]

In the first edition Beilhack [-@beilhack1832: 184-185] uses horizontal braces to indicate the syntactic parts of a sentence, as shown in [@fig:beilhack1832_196] for the example sentence in [@next]. This example illustrates what he calls the *natürliche Topic* 'natural topic', i.e. the default word order for a German sentence. The different parts of the sentence are called *Factoren*. Note that the final verbal particle *ab* is not identified as being part of the main verb. There is no hierarchical analysis of sentence structure. This example is removed starting with the third edition [@beilhack1834], in which the discussion of the syntax gets a major revision, citing Becker (see [@sec:becker1829]) as an influence.

### Honcamp (1838) *Leitfaden für die Sprachbildung*

*Franz* Cornelius Honcamp (1805-1866) was a teacher in Büren (Westfalen). He wrote various grammatical textbooks, strongly influenced by Becker (see [@sec:becker1829]) and Diesterweg (see [@sec:diesterweg1830]). Because of a small article, in which he implicitly criticised the role of the church in schools, he was eventualy laid off by the Prussian state in 1854 and worked as a private teacher for the last few years of his life. More biographical details and a detailed discussion of the unfortunate clash with church and state is provided by Diesterweg [-@diesterweg1866].^[A useful summary of Honcamps life and work is available online at <https://www.lexikon-westfaelischer-autorinnen-und-autoren.de/autoren/honcamp-franz-cornelius>, accessed 11 February 2025.]

Honcamp's first grammatical book is called *Leitfaden für die Sprachbildung in deutschen Volkschulen* [@honcamp1838]. In the subtitle he mentions the explicit influence from the work of Becker: *Begründet auf Dr. K.F.Becker’s grammatische Ansicht, und fachgemäß methodologisch angeordnet* 'based on Dr. K.F.Becker’s grammatical view, and properly methodologically arranged'. Specifically, Honcamp uses the tabular analysis from Becker, in which each row is numbered [@honcamp1838: 259-260, 271-275]. An extensive explanation of Honcamp's syntactic analysis is provided in his *Vollständige Anleitung zum Elementar-Unterrichte in der Sprachlehre* [@honcamp1841: 13, 21, 30, 87, 90, 224-226]. This book is dedicated to Becker and follows his proposals almost verbatim. An example of a Becker-style numbered table from this book is shown in [@fig:honcamp1841_224] for the biblical example in [@next]. This numbering allows for concrete reference of dependent words to their heads. Exactly the same use of numbered reference is (again) used by contemporary dependency grammar formats like *Universal Dependencies* (UD). Similar examples of syntactic analysis are also included in later books by Honcamp, e.g. in his *Gedanken über den Unterricht in der Sprachlehre* [@honcamp1845: 29, dedicated to Diesterweg] and *Lehr- und Übungsbuch für den Sprachunterricht in niederdeutschen Landschulen* [@honcamp1851: 19-20].

### Hoffmann (1839) *Neuhochdeutsche Schulgrammatik* {#sec:hoffmann1839}

Karl August Julius Hoffmann (1812-1869) was a schooldirector in Lüneburg. He wrote about such disparate topics as Homer, rhetoric, logic, and German grammar. In 1839 he published the first edition of his *Neuhochdeutsche Schulgrammatik* [@hoffmann1839], which he revised in the second edition [@hoffmann1856], but which did not get reprinted after that. In parallel, he also delivered a summarised version of the same work, the *Neuhochdeutsche Elementargrammatik*. This version was much more popular and got reprinted at least up to an eleventh edition in 1885. In the preface of the *Schulgrammatik*, he explicitly cites Becker (see [@sec:becker1829]) and Billroth (see [@sec:billroth1832]). About Billroth he says: *unter den Grammatiken der fremden Sprachen verdanke ich der Lateinischen von Billroth am meisten* 'among the grammars of foreign language I owe most to is the Latin grammar of Billroth' [@hoffmann1839: xiii].

In the *Schulgrammatik* Hoffmann includes a graphical analysis of the example sentence in [@next], as shown in [@fig:hoffmann1839_148] [@hoffmann1839: 148]. The graphical display is closely related to Billroth's display in [@fig:billroth1832_102]. In both graphics, subject and predicate are placed on top, although there is no connecting line in Hoffmann's version. All other modifiers are linked by lines going down. Note that this example even includes subordinated clauses, namely a relative clause *welchen alle bewunderten* and an adverbial clause *ehe es Mittags geworden war*. They are simply treated similar to all other modifiers.

::: ex

This image is actually an idental graphic from the fourth edition of the *Elementargrammatik* because of the better quality of the scan of that edition [@hoffmann1856: 137]. The structure of the graphic is clearly inspired by Billroth (see [@fig:billroth1832_102]), who is explicitly cited as inspiration by Hoffmann.
:::

Hofmann also uses vertical lines to illustrate the structore of complex sentences consisting of multiple clauses. Interestingly, he separates the discussion of syntactic analysis, using the heading *mehrfacher Satz* 'multiple clause' [-@hoffmann1839: 148], from the section on the stilistic analysis, using the heading *Periode*. However, there does not seem to be a clear separation between the two. The example of a *mehrfacher Satz* [@next] is called a *Periode*. This example is artificially contructed, and in a later edition Hoffmann adds a footnote to excuse for the stilistically poor example:

> Die Periode steht hier nur der grammatischen Analyse halber. Stilistisch ist sie mangelhaft, weil viele gleichförmige Satzausgänge unmittelbar auf einander folgen, sobald man die Nebensätze an ihre richtige Stelle bringt. [@hoffmann1856: 109]
>
> ('This *Periode* is only included here for the sake of grammatical analysis. Stilistically she is defective, because many similarly formed subordinate endings follow each other immediately when the subordinate clauses are placed in their rightfull position.')

::: ex

:::

Hoffmann uses various devices in the graphical analysis of this complex sentence, though there are many unexplained features and apparently some inconsistencies: 

- First, he uses latin lower-case letters for the different clauses, but he simply starts with *a* for the main clause and every subordinate clauses is given a subsequent letter depending on the depth of the subordination. This is yet another use of letters, different from Herling's, Lehmann's and Götzinger's approaches.
- Second, the depth of embedding is additionally indicated by indentation, though the first *c* clause does not follow this rule. 
- Third, subordinate clauses are linked to their superodinate clause by vertical lines. However, he does not do this for the first level embeddings (marked *b*). Possibly he only intends for the lines to appear when the subordinate clause is internal to the superordinate clause.
- Fourth, Hoffmann makes a distinction between clauses linked to a word and clauses linked to a blank position (marked with a long dash). Probably the dash is added when the subordinate clause is in a position not linked to any word at exactly that position. This is reminiscent of a proposal by Götzinger [-@gotzinger1839: 381].

:::

The second edition of the *Schulgrammatik* [@hoffmann1853] takes over exactly the same graphics, but adds a few more examples of *mehrfache Sätze* [@hoffmann1853: 216-217]. And then, completely at the end of the book, before the appendices, he adds the following comment in a small typeface, referring to the example sentence "Nr. 5" repeated below in [@next]:

> Von Perioden kann man Bilder entwerfen, indem man die Hauptsätze mit A B C, die Nebensätze ersten Grades mit a b c, die Nebensätze zweiten Grades mit α β ɣ, die Nebensätze dritten Grades mit 𝔞 𝔟 𝔠 bezeichnet. So ist z.B. das Schema der eben unter Nr. 5 aufgeführten Periode folgendes: [ A a α A b β : B c. ] [@hoffmann1853: 240]
>
> ('It is possible to draft pictures of *Perioden* by indicating main clauses with A B C, first level subordinate clauses with a b c, second level subordinate clauses with α β ɣ, third level subordinate clauses with 𝔞 𝔟 𝔠. In this way, for example, the scheme of the *Periode* Nr. 5 is [ A a α A b β : B c. ].')

[@hoffmann1853: 239, citing Fichte]
:::

The use of letters in different typefaces is clearly inspired by Lehmann (see [@sec:lehmann1833]), but Hoffmann removes all internal structure of the *Periodenbild*. The idea to simplify Lehmann's notation to a single line might have been inspired by Rinne (see [@sec:rinne1840]) or Nägelsbach (see [@sec:nägelsbach1846]). All in all, this *Periodenbild* feels like an afterthought, which Hoffmann never expanded upon in later editions of the *Elementargrammatik*.

In summary, Hoffmann tried to expand the proposals from Billroth by applying the grammatical line-graphics to subordinate clauses. Although his system is not well documented in his writings, it is comprehensible enough the be understood by experienced linguists. It has inspired Bauer (see [@sec:bauer1850]) and Kern ([@sec:kern1883]) to further develop the idea of line-based gramatical analyses.

### Mager (1840) *Französisches Sprachbuch* {#sec:mager1840}

*Karl* Wilhelm Eduard Mager (1810-1858) was a school teacher and educator. He was a close collaborator of Diesterweg (see [@sec:diesterweg1830]). Some basic biographical information is provided by Kronen [-@kronen1987].

Early in his career, Mager wrote a French textbook that includes graphical grammar [@mager1840: 249-253], revised in the fourth edition [@mager1847: 316-322]. Exactly the same edition is reprinted at least up to the seventh edition [@mager1854: 316-322]. 

Exactly the same system that was used for German multi-clause sentences is used here for French sentences, like [@next a] analysed in [@fig:mager1847_319]. This example is a quotation from the *Sermon pour le premier dimanche de carême* of Jean-Baptiste Massillon. However, the precise formulation of the quotation indicates that this example is not quoted directly from Massillon, but indirectly from the *Cours d'études* of Étienne Bonnot de Condillac. Remarkably, Condillac cites this example as *une période qui n'est pas si bein faite, parce qu'il y a trop de propositions incidentes dans le premier membre* 'a period that is not so well constructed, because there are too many auxiliary propositions in the first member' [@condillac1775: 87-88]. Mager just notes that *[…] Regeln über Richtigkeit, Deutlichkeit, Schönheit u.s.w. der Perioden hier nicht am Orte sind* 'rules about correctness, clarity, beauty, etc. of the periods are not at issue here' [@mager1840: 250].

Mager uses multiple visual clues to illustrate the structure of a sentence, many of which appear to be inspired by Lehmann (see [@sec:lehmann1833]) and Hoffmann (see [@sec:hoffmann1839]), neither of whom are cited by Mager. Mager's analytic system is illustrated here in [@fig:mager1842_118] for the multi-clause sentence [@next].

First, each clause is placed on a separate line. Second, clausal subordination is indicated by indentation, with multiple subordination leading to multiple indentation. Additionally, sometimes vertical lines are added for subordination, but it is not explained when to do this – and the examples given are also inconclusive. Third, he uses arbitrary letters for different kinds of subordination *(a=Attributivsatz, b=Substantivsatz, c=Adverbialsatz)*. Fourth, secondary subordination is indicated with lower-case greek letters *αβγ* and third-grade subordination is marked by lower-case Fraktur letters *𝔞𝔟𝔠*. Fifth, non-finite clauses are indicated by an additional apostrophe. Finally, coordinated clauses have an additional numeral.

:::

Two years after the French textbook, Mager also wrote a similar textbook about German grammar, called *Deutsches Sprachbuch. Anfänge der Grammatik, Onomatik und Sprachkunst* [@mager1842]. In this book he uses a slightly different graphical approach (though based on the same principles) for the analysis for complex sentences, illustrating his system with many examples [@mager1842: 115-119].

::: ex

The application of vertical lines appears to be haphazard.

### Rinne (1840) *Die Lehre vom deutschen Stile* {#sec:rinne1840}

Karl Johann Friedrich Rinne (1802-1887) was a teacher in Erfurt and Zeitz. He wrote various textbooks including *Die deutsche Grammatik* in 1836. This textbook is an introduction to the latest developments in historical comparative grammar written specifically "for teachers and all those, who want to become acquainted with the contemporary position of this science" (*für Lehrer und für alle, welche sich mit dem gegenwärte Standpunkte dieser Wissenschaft vertraut machen wollen*). However, this textbook does not have any graphical grammatical analyses.

Yet, in the first volume of his multi-volume *Lehre vom deutschen Stile*, published between 1840 and 1847, Rinne uses a system of symbols which he calls *Periodensymbolik* [@rinne1840: 276]. He explicitly references the "more extensive system" of Lehmann (see [@sec:lehmann1833]). Just as Lehmann, Rinne [-@rinne1840: 272-276] uses capital letters for main clauses and lower-case letters for subordinate clauses. Closer to Herling (see [@sec:herling1823]), recursively embedded clauses are indicated by superscripts, though using roman numerals. Central to Rinne's approach is a major separation of each *Periode* in a *Protasis/Vordersatz* and an *Apodosis/Nachsatz*, visually separated by a colon (cf. Diesterweg's approach in [@fig:diesterweg1838_169]). Additionally, Rinne uses letters *A/a* for the protasis and letters *B/b* for the apodosis. An example is shown in [@fig:rinne1840_274] for the example sentence in [@next] from Rinne [-@rinne1840: 274].

The result of Rinne's graphical choices is a symbolic analysis on a single line, which makes it much easier to include it in a written text compared to the visually more involved approach by Lehmann. The concept of reducing the sentence scheme to a single line is similarly used by various later authors, for example by Nägelsbach (see [@sec:nägelsbach1846]) and by Hoffmann in his second edition (see [@sec:hoffmann1839]). These similarities could very well have been developed independently, though.

Different from Lehmann and Götzinger, this approach keeps the symbols on a single line, which makes it easier to include in written text, but much less visually appealing. Note that for easier interpretation, the period-symbols in thie analysis might better be replaced by the actual commas or semicolons as they occur in the example sentence.

### Haupt (1841) *Deutsche Prosa* {#sec:haupt1841}

Friedrich Haupt (1805-1891) was a teacher in Zürich and later pastor in the Odenwald region. More biographical information is available in Haupt [-@haupt1905]. During his time in Zürich he wrote various textbooks and prepared an anthology of the German language in his book *Deutsche Sprache und Literatur*. The second part of this anthology, *Deutsche Prosa* [@haupt1841], contains a preface on didactical methods, including syntactic analysis. This preface is removed in later editions of the anthology.^[Compare the 1865 edition available online at <https://mdz-nbn-resolving.de/bsb10597896>.]

In this preface, Haupt is exceedingly enthousiastic about the syntactic approach of Becker. He heralds him as the founder of a new linguistics:

> Becker […] Einer der scharfsinnigsten Sprachforscher, der der Begründer eines neuen Sprachsystems, und einer wahrhaft formal bildenden Unterrichtsmethode geworden ist [@haupt1841: 295]
>
> ('Becker […] One of the most astute linguists, who has become the founder of a new language system and a true formally-educating method of teaching.')

In a footnote Haupt even announces that he will publish an extensive analysis of Becker's method in a book to be called *K. F. Becker und die deutsche Volksschule. Ein Beitrag zur Förderung deutscher Sprachwissenschaft und Methodik* [@haupt1841: viii]. Unfortunately, he does not appear to have ever finished this planned book.

As an example of Becker's syntactic analysis, Haupt analysed the example sentence [@next] from Jean Paul. In a first step he separates the various clauses and illustrates their interrelation with the graphical display in [@fig:haupt1841_viii]. Subsequently, Haupt also analyses the internal structure of one of the main clauses, but this is only done in words. Note that Haupt's graphical approach, using hierarchically-ordered reversed horizontal braces, is not found in the work of Becker (see [@sec:becker1829]). However, it is reminiscent of the visual approach by Diesterweg in [@fig:diesterweg1830_174].

::: ex

[@haupt1841: viii, citing Jean Paul]
:::

The abbreviations that are used in the graphical analysis can be reconstructed from the text as follows:

- **Main clause** (*Haupts.*): *Der wahnsinnige Sterbliche begeht seine Sünden so kühn,* 
- **Causal subordinate clause** (*begründ. Nebs.*): *blos weil sich ihm ihre mörderischen Folgen verhüllen;*
- **Coordinated main clauses** (*haupts. zusammengezog.) *er kettet die in seiner Brust eingesperrten reißenden Thiere los und lässet sie in der Nacht unter die Menschn dringen;*
- **Adversative main clause** (*advers. Hpts.*): *aber er siehet es nicht,* 
- **Complement clause** (*obj. Nebs.*): *wie viele Unschuldige das losgebundene Unthier ergreife und würge.*

### Fürg (1847) *Satz und Styllehre* {#sec:fürg1847}

Johann Baptist Fürg (1802-1864) was a teacher in München. Not much is known about him, except for a glowing necrolog [@heitz1864]. He wrote various small booklets for use in school, among them a four volume grammar *Die deutsche Sprache dargestellt in Aufgaben sammt den nöthigsten Erläuterungen für die Volksschulen Bayerns* [@furg1850]. However, in that work there are no graphical methods used.

Earlier he wrote smaller textbook *Die Satz- und Styllehre mit Inbegriff der Wortbiegung, dargestellt in 760 Aufgaben sammt den nöthigsten Erläuterungen*, which was first published in 1845. In the fourth edition of 1847 he expanded the preface [cf. the third edition without it, @furg1846]. In this new preface, he addresses the teachers and presents to them a few examples of how to analyse sentences [@furg1847: vi-viii]. One of these examples is shown in [@fig:fürg1847_vii]. This numbered tabular analysis is strongly reminiscent of Becker's approach (see [@sec:becker1829]). Becker is not mentioned in Fürg's text, but Fürg calls this approach *Analyse* or *Zergliederung*, and these are both words used by Becker. It is also telling that these examples are directed to teachers, not students, which is again similar to Becker. Finally, Fürg calls himself an adherent of the "new grammar", which might be a reference to Becker's approach to grammar:

> Aus dem bisher Gesagten geht zur Genüge hervor, daß ich mich entschieden als Anhänger der neuen Grammatik bekenne, und daß ich sie als den einzigen Weg betrachte, der zum wahren Verstehen der Sprache führt. [@furg1847: viii]
>
> ('It is clear from what has been said upto now, that I resolutely declare myself to be an adherent of the new grammar, and that I consider it to be the only way that will lead to a real understanding of language.')

This analysis is strongly reminiscent of Becker's tabular analysis (see [@fig:becker1829_xvii]), although Fürg does not explicitly acknowledge Becker. Note that subject (*Satzding*) and predicate (*Aussage*) are not linked by the numbering, which is different from Becker's examples.

### Bauer (1850) *Neuhochdeutsche Grammatik* {#sec:bauer1850}

Friedrich Bauer (1812-1874) was the founding director of a missionary education centre in the Bavarian city of Neuendettelsau. This institute is still active today as *Mission EineWelt*. Among other duties, Bauer also taught religion and German grammar at his institute [@fuchshuber2013: 93]. In that context he wrote the *Grundzüge der neuhochdeutschen Grammatik für die unteren und mittleren Klassen höherer Bildungsanstalten*, which was first published in 1850. Bauer himself delivered various editions of this book up to his death in 1874.

After Bauer's death, the German dictionary maker Konrad Duden kept producing new editions of this grammar, with only very minor changes. The *Neuhochdeutsche Grammatik* remained popular and has seen at least 27 editions, including special editions for Austria, for protestant schools, and for catholic schools. The last edition was published in 1912 [see @fuchshuber2013: 115-117, 128-131 for a survey of all editions]. However, even that was not the end: Bauer's text was given a second life in the context of the expanding *Duden* "empire". In the century since the death of Konrad Duden in 1911, the name *Duden* has become a household name in Germany for everything related to the German language. The 11th edition of the Duden dictionary in 1935 was expanded with a German grammar, prepared under the auspice of Otto Basler [@basler1935]. This grammar was basically a new edition of Bauer's *Neuhochdeutsche Grammatik* (without clear attribution). Only after the Second World War the *Duden* grammar was completely rewritten. Updated editions of this rewritten grammar are still popular today in Germany.

In the grammatical analysis of complex sentences, Bauer [-@bauer1850: 94-97] uses a graphical display that is eerily similar to the one proposed by Hoffmann (see [@sec:hoffmann1839]). Although Hoffmann is not cited by Bauer, it is known that Bauer had a copy of Hoffmann's grammar in his personal library [@fuchshuber2013: 99], so an influence seems highly likely. The first few examples of Bauer's syntactic analysis are shown in [@fig:bauer1850_95] [@bauer1850: 95]. These examples are also found in exactly the same layout 85 years later in Basler [-@basler1935: 254]. Each sentence is analyzed in two ways: the text itself is subdivided into clauses, with subordinate clauses shifted down vertically and connected with lines, very similar to Hoffmann (see [@fig:hoffmann1839_224]). 

Additionally, Bauer adds structural analyses in the form of letters, with capital letters for main clauses and lower-case letters for subordinate clauses. First-level subordination is separated by a comma, while secondary or deeper subordination is indicated by vertical lines and numerical superscripts. Bauer uses different lower-case letters for different kind of subordinate clauses [@bauer1850: 94], though the assignemt of the letters is completely unmnemonical, namely *a* for complement clauses (*Substantivsatz*), *b* for relative clauses (*Adjectivsatz*) and *c* for adverbial clauses (*Adverbialsatz*). The so-called *verkürzte* subordinate clauses (i.e. *zu+Infinitiv* constructions) have dashes *-a-, -b-, -c-*, but Bauer explains in a later edition that this was supposed to be a strikethrough [@bauer1863: footnote on p. 145].

::: {.im #bauer1850_95}
The first three examples of Bauer's sentence analysis [@bauer1850: 95]. There are three sentences analyzed in this excerpt, with subordination structure indicated by vertical lines, similar to Hoffman in [@fig:hoffmann1839_224]. Structural patterns are added to the side, summarising the structure with letters (*A*=main clause, *a*=complement clause, *b*=relative clause, *c*=adverbial clause) and superscripts for secondary embedding.
:::

A more complex example discussed by Bauer is the sentence in [@next], analyzed as [@fig:bauer1850_97] [@bauer1850: 97]. Again, there is both an analysis of all main and subordinate clauses, written out with subordination marked by vertical lines, and there is a structural pattern with letters and symbols in the bottom right. This structural pattern has two cases of coordination (marked by a plus symbol), an internal subordination (marked by the brackets), a secondary subordination (marked by a vertical line) and a subordination at the end of the sentence (marked by a comma). Probably it is more accurate to analyze the subordination *c* as a simple frontal embedding of the second conjunct, using a comma in the analysis instead of brackets for a clause-internal embedding (viz. *A+c,A,a+a* instead of *A+A(c)A,a+a*), but that is some minor nitpicking.

In this edition he also promises to write a more extensive explanation of his notation, but he never seems to have done this:

> Die Darstellung solcher Satzbilder durch Formeln ist äußert lehrreich und förderlich, sowohl für das Verständnis schwerer Sätze, als für das Schreiben. […] Solche Formeln zur Darstellung von Satzbildern zu geben, muß sich der Verfaßer vorbehalten für eine besondere kleine Schrift, welche eine Ergänzung der Syntax für eine höhere Lehrstufe bilden soll. [@bauer1863: 128]
>
> The presentation of such *Satzbilder* through formulas is very instructive and beneficial, both for the understanding of difficult sentences and for the writing. […] The demonstration of such formulas of the *Satzbilder* will be reserved for a special small booklet, which will be an extension of the syntax for the for the higher classes.

### Hermes (1852) *Unsere Muttersprache* {#sec:hermes1852}

Karl Ferdinand Hermes (born 1820) was director of a privately run school in Berlin, called *Höhere Töchterschule zum heiligen Kreuz*.^[Annual school-report of 1877: <https://google.com/books?id=oS4-AQAAMAAJ>.] He was also Chairman of the *Verein für höhere Töchterschulen* and Editor-in-Chief of the journal *Stoa: Zeitschrift für die Interessen der höheren Töchterschulen*.^[Digital versions of the journal Stoa from 1868 and 1869: <https://scripta.bbf.dipf.de/viewer/toc/020698577>.] A short biographical profile is given by Schütze [-@schutze2014: 940].

He wrote a German grammar with the name *Unsere Muttersprache*, which was first published in 1852, though it will be quoted here from the fourth edition of 1866 [@hermes1866]. The book reappeared at least until the tenth edition of 1881. He discusses the technique to use a *Satzbild* for sentence analysis in the section *der zusammengesetzte Satz* [@hermes1866: 102, 105]. The details of the notation are rather idiosyncratic, though it is clearly inspired by the concept of the *Periodenbild* of Lehmann and Götzinger. Knowledge about this approach appears to be rather widespread among German teachers by this time, and it is often difficult to reconstruct exactly who has been their direct inspiration.

Hermes analyses the sentence in [@next] with the graphic shown in [@fig:hermes1866_105]. He uses a capital *H* for main clauses (*Hauptsatz*) and the lower-case letters *s* for complement clauses (*substantivisch*), *r* for relative clauses and *a* for adverbial clauses. Inserted clauses (*Zwischensätze*) are indicated by round brackets and secondary subordination is depicated by shifting the letter down. There are no examples with more complex multiple embeddings.

In the lower right corner there is a graphical analysis of the sentence in [@last] by Hermes [-@hermes1866: 105]. The use of the letters is rather idiosyncratic (*H*=main clause, *a*=adverbial clause, *r*=relative clause, *s*=complement clause). Brackets are used for "inserted clauses" and second-level embedding is indicated by lowering the letter in the graphic. This is reminiscent of Lehmann, though the horizontal braces are missing.

### Wander (1856) *Satzbilderschule* {#sec:wander1856}

Karl Friedrich Wilhelm Wander (1803-1879) was a teacher in Silesia and a progressive padagogue in the tradition of Pestalozzi. He was persecuted by the prussian government as a revolutionist and communist, though his views appear moderately liberal-progressive from a contemporary point of view. He was a close friend of Diesterweg (see [@sec:diesterweg1830]) and wrote an influential pamphlet in defence of his friend, called *Der geschmähte Diester­weg*. In German linguistics, he is most well-known for his collection of German proverbs, the *Deutsches Sprichwörter-Lexikon*. Extensive biographical information about Wander is provided by Hohendorf [-@hohendorf1979].

Among Wander's many publications there is a small booklet called *Satzbilderschule* [@wander1856]. It does not seem to have been noted by his contemporaries, and today only very few copies remain available. Wander's analysis of *Satzbilder* closely follows Diesterweg in all its details (see [@sec:diesterweg1830]). Wander's book is organised by possible sentence structures, trying to enumerate all possibilities of complex sentences. With this approach, Wander follows the same plan as Lehmann (see [@sec:lehmann1833]). Both Diesterweg and Lehmann are explicitly mentioned in the preface [@wander1856: vi].

The main part of Wander's book consists only of *Satzbilder* in the form of letter sequences. Each letter encodes a clause, capital letters for main clauses and lower-case letters for subordinate clauses. Superscript numbers indicate the level of embedding. However, in the preface Wander additionally discusses three different kinds of visualisation that can be used to enhance the bare-bones letter-based analysis. The first two visualisations are directly adapted from Diesterweg, but the third appears to be an innovation of Wander himself. 

For the analysis of the example sentence in [@next], Wander proposes two visualisations. First, in [@fig:wander1856_ix], he combines the rising-falling analysis of the *Kommata* in a *Periode* with the letter sequences of the individual clauses. Second, in [@fig:wander1856_x] he uses a grid to show the sequence of clauses from left to right and the depth of embedding from top to bottom. Another example of both these visualisations is found at the end of his book [@wander1856: 63-64].

For the analysis of the  example sentence in [@nnext] Wander uses another visualisation, shown in [@fig:wander1856_x2]. He displays the hierarchical structure by indentation and connects separated parts of the same clause by large brackets. In all these example-visualisations there are minor typographic errors, as discussed below in the captions to the figures. With such complex sentences it turns out to be really difficult to stay faultless, even for an obviously competent author like Wander.

::: ex

*Satzbild* for the example sentence in [@last] from Wander [-@wander1856: ix]. This visualisation is completely parallel to the proposal from Diesterweg (cf. [@fig:diesterweg1834_169]). The lower-case letters are used for subordinate clauses, but the meaning of the different letters remains mysterious from this display. The alternative display in [@fig:wander1856_x] below solves this riddle. Note that there is a minor error in this display, which is corrected in the next figure. The second division (*Kolon*) should have *b^3^* instead of *a^3^*.
:::

::: {.im #wander1856_x}
Alternative *Satzbild* for the example sentence in [@last] from Wander [-@wander1856: x]. The depth of the embedding is indicated by the lower placement in the display. This visualisation is probably inspired by the music-score display, which was proposed as an alternative by Diesterweg (cf. [@fig:diesterweg1834_169]). In this visualisation it becomes clear how the lower-case letters are chosen: on each level of embedding the subordinate clauses are simply assigned in alphabetical order. For example, the first second-order subordinate clause is *a^2^*, the second one is *b^2^*, etc. When the same letter re-occurs in the same level (e.g the clause *c* in the first subordinate level), then this indicates that the clause is separated into two parts. The alphabetical order is reset in a new main clause, cf. in main clause *B* the subordinate clause is *a* again.

Further, the second level subordination inside *c* should have been marked as *d^2^*. The text makes clear that these are purely typographic errors.

### Schötensack (1856) *Grammatik der neuhochdeutschen Sprache*

Heinrich August Schötensack (1812-1891) was a teacher in Stendal. He wrote a massive (more than 800 pages) *Grammatik der neuhochdeutschen Sprache*. It contains just a very short discussion of *Periodenbilder* without much detail [@schotensack1856: 800-802]. The example in [@fig:schötensack1856_801] for the sentence in [@next] clearly shows the influence from Lehmann (see [@sec:lehmann1833]) in the use of the different typefaces for the different levels of embedding. However, even Lehmann did not venture into the Hebrew characters, as is shown here by the use of the Alef for the fifth embedding.

::: ex

Schötensack does not include any more complex examples, but he introduces a Hebrew character Alef for the fifth level of embedding.

### Schlecht (1856) *Denk- und Sprachlehre* {#sec:schlecht1856}

Raymund Schlecht (1811-1891) was director of a teacher's training college in Eichstätt [see @gmelch1931 for biographical details]. Besides being a teacher and theologian, he was a musical researcher. Most of his writings deal with musicology, but he also published a short grammar called *Denk- und Sprachlehre. Ein Leitfaden zur Ertheilung eines organischen Sprachunterrichts* [@schlecht1856]. In the preface he prominently mentions Becker (see [@sec:becker1829]).

The grammar contains a few graphical displays for complex sentences using a musical notation [@schlecht1856: 71, 79]. This is reminiscent of the approach by Herling, as shown in [@fig:herling1828_366], and Diesterweg, as shown in [@fig:diesterweg1834_169]. There is no indication that Herling was an inspiration for Schlecht. In contrast, Schlecht clearly knew about Diesterweg, whom he went to visit in Berlin in 1862 [according to @gmelch1931: 21] and about whose didactic methods he wrote a small note in the *Katholische Schulzeitung* in 1868 [@gmelch1931: 54].^[The small note appeared in two parts, which are available online at <https://www.digitale-sammlungen.de/view/bsb10687402?page=260> and <https://www.digitale-sammlungen.de/view/bsb10687402?page=284>.] Yet, given that Schlecht was more of a musicologist than a linguist, it seems just as likely that he independently came up with the idea of using the musical score for the depiction of linguistic structure.

He uses the musical display in [@fig:schlecht1856_79] to illustrate the structure of the highly complex sentence in [@next]. Before the main clause there are eleven subordinated clauses, separated graphically by a double bar. These eleven subordinated clauses are again subdivided into three subsections devided by a single bar, each of which is again internally complex. The main clause, after the double bar, also has a complex internal structure. It is impressive that grammarians like Schlecht had the audacity to tackle such complex sentences, something rarely seen in contemporary linguistics.

Music-score analysis of the complex sentence in [@last] from Schlecht [@schlecht1856: 79]. The main clauses are placed on the highest line, with subordinate clauses below, depending on the depth of their embedding. Vertical bars separate major parts, with the double vertical bar separating the preposed subordinated clauses from the main clause. The arches are used for conjunction reduction (first arch) and clauses that are interrupted by a subordinate clause (other two arches). The following abbreviations are used: *Vrgl*=*Vergleichssatz*=comparative clause, *B*=*Beifügesatz*=relative clause, *U*=*Umstandssatz*=adverbial clause, *Pr.Th*=*mit dem Prädicat verbundene Thätigkeit*. The intended meaning of the *P* just before the vertical double bar is unclear.

### Bachmann (1864) *Satz- und Wortlehre* {#sec:bachmann1864}

Ferdinand Bachmann (1817-1891) was a teacher and later director of a teachers' seminary in Prague [more biographical details in @jahne1897]. He was chosen for this job partly because of the popularity of his lectures, published 1864 as a textbook *Die Satz- und Wortlehre in praktischen Vorträgen. Ein methodischer Leitfaden zur Behandlung des grammatischen Theils unserer Lesebücher in der Volksschule. Für angehende Lehrer und Lehrerinnen* [@bachmann1868, cited here from the second edition]. The book saw reprints at least up to a fifth edition in 1884.

Bachmann uses *Satzbilder* to illustrate the structure of complex sentences, copying the style from Bauer (see [@sec:bauer1850]), who is not cited. The construction of this graphical display is explained in great detail [@bachmann1868: 97-104] and exemplary applied for various longer sentences in an appendix [@bachmann1868: 244-255]. An example is given below in [@fig:bachmann1868_251] for the example sentence in [@next]. The graphical analysis only deals with the clause structure, but note that conjoined predicates like *schön und edel* 'beautiful and noble' are treated as two conjoined clauses marked with a plus-symbol and a large arch above. Commas are used both for preposed and postposed subordination, while internal subordination is marked by round brackets (not shown in the figure). Secondary and deeper subordination is placed downwards connected by lines and additionally marked by superscript numbers. Strikethrough indicates non-finite clauses. 

::: ex

:::

::: {.im #bachmann1868_251}
*Satzbild* for the example sentence in [@last] in the analysis of Bachmann [-@bachmann1868: 251]. The style of this graphic is copied from the structural summaries of Bauer (cf. [@fig:bauer1850_95]). Commas are used to separate both preposed and postposed subordinate clauses. Deeper embedded clauses use vertical lines and superscript numbers. Strikethrough indicates non-finite clauses.
:::

Bachmann also uses tables, with the each word as a row and two columns for the analysis: one row is called *syntaktisch* (for the syntactic function) and the other row is called *etymologisch* (for the morphological analysis). This approach, including the term "etymology" for what we would today call morphology, is highly reminiscent of the british tradition of parsing as proposed by Murray [-@murray1824: 195]. It could also be an influence from Becker (see [@sec:becker1829]), but Bachmann does not use numbers to explicate the dependencies. This table-style approach is first introduced only for syntactic functions [@bachmann1868: 38], but later applied in great detail in the appendix including morphological analysis [@bachmann1868: 244-255]. A tabular analysis of the first subordinate part of example [@last] is showhn in [@fig:bachmann1868_251a].

::: {.im #bachmann1868_251a}
Tabular analysis of the first subordinate part of examples sentence [@last]. This tabular analysis both has a column for syntactic function *(syntaktisch)* and a column for morphological structure *(etymologisch)*. This might be an influence from Becker (cf. [@fig:becker1829_xvii]), but the absence of any numbering and the use of the term "etymology" also points to a direct influence from the english tradition of Murray [e.g. -@murray1824: 195].
:::

### Wetzel & Wetzel (1865) *Die deutsche Sprache* {#sec:wetzel1865}

Eduard and Friedrich Wetzel were brothers and both teachers in Berlin. Friedrich Ludwig Eduard Wetzel (1819-1895) was a teacher at the *Lehrerinnenseminar* and the *Augustaschule* and Friedrich Wilhelm Eduard Wetzel (1824-1897) was teacher at the *Elisabethschule*. A few more biographical details are available in the *Personenregister* of Schütze [-@schutze2014: 885-886]. 

In 1865 they wrote a textbook on German grammar, called *Die deutsche Sprache. Eine nach methodischen Grundsätzen bearbeitete Grammatik für höhere Lehranstalten und zum Selbstunterricht*, which was reprinted at least until the 13th edition of 1914. This book is cited here in the third edition [@wetzel1871], which is the earliest version that I have been able to access. From the prefaces of the earlier version it does not appear that the graphical analysis has seen much change since the first edition. The same analysis is also found in the first edition of the shortened version, called *Leitfaden für den Unterricht in der deutschen Sprache* [@wetzel1868: 182]. This shorter book has also been reprinted numerous times, retaining the same graphical analyses, at least up to a 46th edition [@wetzel1893: 223-224].

Their analysis of multi-clause sentences is limited to inserting symbols into the text at the end of each clause [@wetzel1871: 313-314], similar to Herling [-@herling1823] as shown in [@fig:herling1832_232]. Wetzel & Wetzel use capital letters for main clause and lower-case letters for subordinate clauses, with superscript numbers for the depth of the embedding. All subordinate clauses of a specific main clause use the same letter, e.g. all *A/a* or *B/b* etc. An example of their analysis is shown in [@fig:wetzel1871_313] for the example sentence in [@next].

### Lehmann (1870) *Leitfaden für den Unterricht* {#sec:lehmann1870}

Josef Lehmann (1838-1911) was a teacher at the teachers' seminary in Vienna (Austria), not related to Johann Lehmann (see [@sec:lehmann1833]). A few biographical details about Josef Lehmann are available in Klein [-@klein1993]. Lehmann wrote various popular textbooks that all saw many different editions:

- *Leitfaden für den Unterricht in der deutschen Grammatik. Für Real- und Bürgerschulen*. First edition 1870, reissued at least until the 9th edition of 1894. It is cited her from the first edition [@lehmann1870].
- *Deutsche Schulgrammatik: Für Lehrerbildungsanstalten und zum Selbstunterrichte*. First edition in 1875, reissued at least until the 11th edition of 1912. It is cited here from the second edition [@lehmann1878]. This book became an official textbook for use in teacher's education in 1876 [as mentioned in the *Vorrede zur zweiten Auflage* of @lehmann1878].
- *Sprachbuch für österreichische Volks- und Bürgerschulen*. First edition 1878, consisting of four volumes. Cited here is the fourth volume for classes six to eight [@lehmann1878a]. Revised after Lehmann's death by Rudolf Löhrl with a slightly changed title as *Deutsches Sprachbuch für österreichische Bürgerschulen*.
- *Sprachbuch für österreichische Volksschulen*. First edition 1879, consisting of two volumes, apparently a simplified version of the previous book. This version does not contain any graphical display [@lehmann1879]. Revised after Lehmann's death by Rodulf Löhrl under the title *Deutsches Sprachbuch für österreichische allgemeine Volksschulen*.

All visual methods for grammatical analysis used by Lehmann are already present in the *Leitfaden*, in which he cites Bauer (see [@sec:bauer1850]) and Götzinger (see [@sec:götzinger1836]) among his sources [@lehmann1870: v]. Lehmann uses three different approaches for syntactic analysis. First, he uses a tabular analysis like Bachmann (see [@sec:bachmann1864]), which is called *Wort- und Satzanalyse*. Shown in [@fig:lehmann1870_186] is only the first part of a long sentence analysed by Lehmann [-@lehmann1870: 186-187]. As discussed for Bachmann (cf. [@fig:bachmann1868_251a]), this might be an influence from Becker (cf. [@fig:becker1829_xvii]), though crucially the idea of using numbered rows is missing.

::: {.im #lehmann1870_186}
Tabular *Wort- und Satzanalyse* from Lehmann [-@lehmann1870: 186]. This approach is very likely taken from Bachmann (cf. [@fig:bachmann1868_251a]). The table does not have clear separate columns for the announced "word" and "sentence" analysis like the two columns used by Bachmann. However, on closer inspection it can be discerned that the last word on each line of this table from Lehmann is reserved for the functional sentence analysis, except for the functionwords.
:::

Second, for complex sentences Lehmann uses a letter-based *Satzbild* [@lehmann1870: 217-218; see also *Schulgrammatik*: @lehmann1878: 281-282; and *Sprachbuch*: @lehmann1878a: 128]. He use a simplified one-line approach with lower-case letters indicating the function of the subordinate clause (e.g. *o=Objektsatz*, *k=Kausalsatz*, *m=Modalsatz).* Depth of embedding is indicated by a number after the letter and non-finite clauses by an additional letter *v=verkürzt*. An example is shown in [@fig:lehmann1870_218] for the example sentence in [@next].

::: ex
[A]{.grey} Thu', [o]{.grey} was jeder loben müsste, [k2]{.grey} wenn die ganze Welt es wüsste; [B]{.grey} thu' es, [m]{.grey} dass es niemand weiß, und [C]{.grey} gedoppelt ist dein Preis. [@lehmann1870: 218, citing an aphorism of Friedrich Rückert]
:::

::: {.im #lehmann1870_218}
*Satzbild* for the example sentence in [@last] from Lehmann [-@lehmann1870: 218]. This is stripped-down one-lined *Satzbild*, with the syntactic function of subordinated clauses being shown by the letters (e.g. *o=Objektsatz*, *k=Kausalsatz*, *m=Modalsatz).* The depth of embedding is indicated by numbers after the letters. 
:::

Finally, for even larger syntactic complexes Lehmann uses a *Bild der Periode* [@lehmann1870: 223-224; see also *Schulgrammatik*: @lehmann1878: 288]. This graphical display, as shown in [@fig:lehmann1870_224] for the *Periode* in [@next], is obviously similar to the approach of Diesterweg (see [@sec:diesterweg1830]). However, it might also have been an influence from Wander (see [@sec:wander1856]), who himself was influenced by Diesterweg. The separation of the *Periode* in a rising and a falling part is indicated by the slanted lines, the letters represent the various clauses.

::: ex
[s]{.grey} Dass die goldenen Tage der harmlosen Kindheit so schnell verschwinden; [s]{.grey} dass die Blüten unsrer edelsten Freuden so bald abfallen; [s]{.grey} dass Freunde, [a]{.grey} die es oft am treuesten meinen, [s]{.grey} am ehesten von unsrer Seite geriffen werden: [A]{.grey} das versetzt den gefühlvollen Menschen nicht selten in stille Wehmuth.
:::

::: {.im #lehmann1870_224}
*Bild der Periode* for the sentence in [@last] from Lehmann [-@lehmann1870: 224]. This graphical approach with rising and falling sections is clearly inspired by Diesterweg (cf. [@fig:diesterweg1834_169]) or possibly by Wander (cf. [@fig:wander1856_ix]), who himself took it from Diesterweg. The abbreviations stand for *s=Subjektsatz* and *a=Attributsatz*, with the arch connecting parts of the same clause that is separated by another clause. The depth of embedding is left out, though this might be an error, as it should be *a2* instead of just *a* according to Lehmann's rules.
:::

### Zitzlsperger (1871) *Leitfaden für den Unterricht* {#sec:zitzlsperger1871}

Joseph Zitzlsperger (1853?-1893) was a teacher in Amberg. He wrote textbooks about accounting, history and German language. His book *Leitfaden für den Unterricht in den Anfängen der deutschen Sprachwissenschaft an Mittelschulen* [@zitzlsperger1871: 133-135] contains is a short discusion about *Satzbilder*, very much in the tradition of the *Periodenbilder* of Bauer (see [@sec:bauer1850]). 

The use of the symbols clearly shows a direct influence from Bauer, especially the variant from Bauer's 1863 revision, although this influence is not explicitly mentioned by Zitzlsperger. The main aspect of the graphical display that is added by Zitzlsperger is the underlining of the letters. A single underline indicates a *bekleidete* 'dressed' clause, while a double underline stands for a *zusammengezogene* 'drawn together' clause (roughly a clause that is the result of conjunction reduction, i.e. a clause-internal conjunction that could be analysed as the result of two clauses with duplicated elements removed). Basic subject+predicate clauses, i.e. *nackte* 'naked' clauses, are not underlined

Another difference in Zitzlsperger's notation is the meaning of superscript numbers. Bauer used them to indicate the depth of embedding (in the tradition of Herling, see [@sec:herling1823]). However, the depth of the embedding is also indicated by the vertical displacement, i.e. graphically lower placement of the letter indicates the depth of the embedding. Omitting the double marking of depth, Zitzlsperger repurposed the superscript numbers to refer to different kinds of adverbial clauses. However, the meaning of the numbers are now completely arbitrary, e.g. *1* stands for locative clauses and *2* for temporal clauses, *3* for comparative clauses, etc. [@zitzlsperger1871: 140].

### Schütze (1875) *Über den deutschen Gliedsatz* {#sec:schütze1875}

Adolf Schütze (born 1824) was a teacher at the Karls-Gymnasium in Bernburg. In the school's yearbook of 1875 he wrote a small essay *Über den deutschen Gliedersatz (Periode) und die Gesetze seines Baues* [@schutze1875], which includes an interesting graphical syntactic analysis. He analyses a long quote from Friedrich Schiller [@next], consisting of four sentences with numerous subordinate clauses. This long and complex linguistic structure is very concisely summarised by the graphic in [@fig:schütze1875_15]. In a footnote he cites Herling, Lehmann, Becker and Haupt [@schutze1875: 8], but the graphical display is more similar to Diesterwegs's approach (see [@fig:diesterweg1834_169]). However, the details are completely idiosyncratic:

- Main clauses are marked with a capital letter *A*
- Different levels of embedding are indicated both by graphically lower placement and by different lower-case letters
- The letter *k* indicates *kurz*, i.e. a shortened *zu+Infinitiv* clause
- Arches connect separated parts from the same clause
- Plusses connect clauses with shared arguments
- Punctuation like commas, colons and semicolons are copied verbatim from the sentence into the graphic display.

- sehr natürlich also, dass ihre Unterhändler in den Provinzen nicht unterlassen haben werden, die unterdrückten Religionsverwandten zu verwegenen Hoffnungen zu ermuntern, ihre Erbitterung gegen die herrschende Kirche auf alle Arten zu nähren, den Druck, worunter sie seufzte, zu übertreiben, und sie dadurch unvermerkt zu Unthaten fortzureissen.

- (dies Alles) wäre allein schon darum nicht glaublich, weil diese wüthende That in ihrer Entstehung zu rasch, in ihrer Ausführung zu leidenschaftlich, zu ungeheuer erscheint, um nicht die Geburt des Augenblicks zu sein, in welchem sie ans Licht trat, und weil sie aus dem Umständen, die ihr vorhergingen, so natürlich gliesst, dass es so tiefer Nachsuchungen nicht bedarf, um ihre Entstehung zu erklären. \

Schütze calls this a *Gedankenperiode* 'thought-period' consisting of four sentences with 35 different subordinate clauses. The details of the abbreviations are rather idiosyncratic. By this point it seems like the idea of a *Periodenbild* is widely known, and the details of the notation are simply reinvented anew every time.

### Gelbe (1877) *Deutsche Sprachlehre* {#sec:gelbe1877}

Theodor Gelbe (1837-1892) was a school director in Stollberg. He wrote a textbook about German grammar called *Deutsche Sprachlehre für höhere Lehranstalten sowie zum Selbststudium* [@gelbe1877]. Apparently this book was not very popular, as it does not seem to have been reprinted. A reviewer was very critical of the principle of using a graphical display for the analysis of sentences, which prompted Gelbe to write a quite ironical rebuttal [@gelbe1880]. In this paper, Gelbe lists various other examples of *Satzbilder* (citing Lehmann, Götzinger, Hoffmann, Bauer and Wetzel), arguing that this approach is widespread and used by respected scholars. It is clear from his writing, that the idea of *Satzbilder* or *Periodenbilder* is well-known in the community of grammatical researchers by this point in the 19th Century, and that each scholar, including Gelbe himself, uses slightly different conventions:

> In der Entwerfung der Satzbilder befolgt man verschiedene Grundsätze, deren keiner jedoch bis jetzt sich allgemeine Anerkennung zu verschaffen vermochte. [@gelbe1877: 150]
>
> ('Different principles are used in the design of *Satzbilder*, none of which has been able to obtain widespread recognition.')

Gelbe's approach [-@gelbe1877: 150-153] seems to be most like the approach from Götzinger (see [@sec:götzinger1836]). Like Götzinger, Gelbe uses different letters for each clause. However, clause-final embedding is indicated by a straight line with the embedding placed below, while Götzinger uses a horizontal brace. Galbe uses the horizontal brace for various kinds of coordination. The superscript *v* stands for *Verkürzung*, i.e. shortened. As an example, Gelbe's analysis of the example from Lessing in [@next] is given here in [@fig:gelbe1877_152].

### Diringer (1878) *Die Periode oder der Gliedersatz* {#sec:diringer1878}

Joseph Diringer (1878-1883) was a teacher for German, Latin and Greek in Eichstätt. Besides various editions of classical texts, he wrote *Die Periode oder der Gliedersatz in der deutschen Sprache* [@diringer1878]. The second half of this small booklet is devoted to the application of *Periodenbilder* to the analysis of literary sentences.

At the end of the preface to his book, Diringer cites many of the graphical approaches that are discussed above (e.g. Bauer, Becker, Götzinger, Herling, Lehmann), but the direct influences on Diringer's graphical display seem to be Schlecht (see [@sec:schlecht1856]) and Schütze (see [@sec:schütze1875]). He uses a quasi-music-score approach with horizontal lines for the depth of embedding and vertical lines for the separation of main sentences. Different lower-case letters are used for distinct kind of subordination, e.g. *s* for *Subjektivsatz* 'subject complement clause' and *l* for *Lokalsatz* 'local clause', etc. As an example of his approach, the sentence from Schiller in [@next] is analysed by Diringer as shown in [@fig:diringer1878_48].

Different lower-case letters are used for different subordinating functions (*m*=modal, *f*=final, *a*=attributive). The small *x* indicates reduces clauses with *zu-Infinitiv*.

### Esser (1878) *Abhandlung über die Formen der Periode* {#sec:esser1878}

Franz Esser (dates unknown) was a teacher in Weissenburg. In the yearly report of his Gymnasium for the year 1877-1878 he writes a short article with the title *Abhandlung über die Formen der Periode im Nibelungenlied* [@esser1878]. In this article he analyses sentences from the *Nibelungenlied* by using *Periodenbilder*. He organises the article by the complexity of the sentences. 

For the inspiration of the *Periodenbilder* he cites Götzinger (see [@sec:götzinger1836]). However, different from Götzinger, Esser does not use the horizontal brace for post-clausal subordination. Instead, he uses forward slashes like Nägelsbach (see [@sec:nägelsbach1846]) or Menge (see [@sec:menge1873]). For multiple embedding Esser uses apostrophes, similary to Rinne (see [@sec:rinne1840]). As an example, the verse from the *Nibelungenlied* in [@next a], with an approximate translation into English in [@next b], is analysed by Esser as [@next c]. The original display is shown in [@fig:esser1878_7].

### Sanders (1879) *Deutsche Sprachbriefe* {#sec:sanders1879}

Daniel Sanders (1819-1897) was a school director in Strelitz and private scholar after his shool had to close. He is most well-known for his lexicographical work [biographical details in @hasszumkehr1995]. He also wrote a German grammar *Deutsche Sprachlehre für Volks- und Bürgerschulen* [@sanders1876], but it contains almost no analysis of sentence structure. Relevant for the topic of graphical analysis are his *Deutsche Sprachbriefe* [@sanders1879], a collection of instructional texts about grammar and style addressed to a general audience. It is a collection of short explanations of grammatical phenomena, illustrated with literary examples. There are also many exercises with solutions appearing in later issues. 

Starting in the 10th issue, he introduces the concept of *Satzbild* [@sanders1879: 167]. Subordinate clauses are indicated by a lower-case letter corresponding to the capital for the main clause. Coordinated subordinate clauses are indicated by a number before the letter (e.g. *2a*), while superscript numbers and different typefaces are used for the depth of the embedding (e.g. *𝔞^2^* using a small fraktur letter *a*). These conventions are closest to the original abbreviations introduced by Herling all the way back in 1823 (see [@fig:herling1832_232]).

Throughout the issues of the *Sprachbriefe* Sanders returns to these *Satzbilder*, adding brackets and horizontal braces. The brackets are particularly interesting, as he uses them hierarchically to enclose multiple embeddings. Horizontal braces are used to link parts of a clause that are separated by internally embedded clauses. An example of his analysis for a sentence from Goethe in [@next a] is repeated in [@next b] as shown in the original in [@fig:sanders1879_263].

The hierarchical structure of the subordination is indicated by brackets inside brackets. The horizontal brace is used to link elements of a clause that are separted by other clauses.

### Blatz (1879) *Neuhochdeutsche Grammatik* {#sec:blatz1879}

Friedrich Blatz (1824-1900) was a teacher in Offenburg and later *Oberschulinspektor* in Ober-Elsaß [biographical details in @oster1906]. Towards the end of his career he wrote the massive (almost 900 pages) *Neuhochdeutsche Grammatik mit Berücksichtigung der historischen Entwicklung der deutschen Sprache* [@blatz1879], only to be outdone by his third edition, which is expanded up to almost 2200 pages in two volumes, published after his retirement. The second volume contains a much expanded analysis of sentences structure [@blatz1896]. There exists also a shorter version of the book, the *Neuhochdeutsche Schulgrammatik*, which saw eleven editions between 1881 and 1918, but this shortened version does not contain any graphical analysis.

In the first edition, completely at the end of the book, after the discussion of the *Periode*, Blatz adds a short discussion about *Satzbilder* [@blatz1879: 866-871]. The abbreviations used look very much like the system from Gelbe (see [@sec:gelbe1877]), especially the superscript *v* for *Verkürzung*, i.e. non-finite subordinate clauses. Blatz also offers the option to use different letters for different kinds of subordinate clauses, e.g. *m* for modal clauses or *r* for relative clauses. His use of these abbreviations is quite similar, but not identical, to the approach used by Diringer (see [@sec:diringer1878]). Blatz does not mention either Gelbe or Diringer. An example of Blatz' approach is shown in [@fig:blatz1879_869] for the example sentence in [@next].

:::

In the major revision of the *Neuhochdeutsch Grammatik* published in 1896 the analysis of sentence structure is greatly expanded. The discussion of the *Periode* is only slightly increased, with most examples being still almost the same [@blatz1896: 1284-1288]. However, Blatz now adds a new section about the internal structure of a clause [@blatz1896: 43-46], using the term *Satzbild* for both analyses. However, the internal structure of a clause looks completely different (see [@fig:blatz1896_45]). This analysis is probably influenced by Kern (see [@sec:kern1883]), whose proposals were published only after the second edition of Blatz' book, but before the major revision. Although Blatz' graphics look rather different from Kern's, it is particularly telling that the verb is now alone at the top of the analysis, with all constituents depending on it, including the subject. In his explanation of this method, Blatz quite confusingly uses many different terms in a single introductory sentence:

> Die Zerlegung des Satzes in seine Glieder (Auflösung, Analyse des Satzes) gründet sich auf das Durchfragen (Kontruieren) desselben. [@blatz1896: 43]
>
> ('The dismantling of the sentence into its pieces (disbandment, analysis of the sentence) is based on recurrent questioning (construction) of the same.')

The graphical structure in [@fig:blatz1896_45] is an analysis of the sentence in [@next]. The verb *heißen* is positioned at the top and all major constituents are listed below it. It is a bit confusing that there are no lines connecting them to the main predicate above. Further modifiers are linked with lines below the major constituents. Complete phrases are repeated, mixing constituency with dependency (to use moder terminology). This mix makes the graphical analysis really confusing to interpret.

This analysis has the verb (*heißen*) alone at the top, with all constituents hanging down from it (not all lines are explicitly drawn, which makes the image quite confusing). All earlier line-drawing have subject and predicate equally placed on the top. This verb-centric analysis is probably inspired by Kern (see Figure ???), whose method was published between the second and third edition of Blatz' book.

### Zettel (1882) *Unterricht in der deutschen Sprache* {#sec:zettel1882}

Karl Zettel (1831-1904) was a teacher in Regensburg and later an editor of de-luxe editions of German poetry in Munich. He wrote a small article about the method of teaching German in schools, called *Auf welche Weise kann der Unterricht in der deutschen Sprache und Literatur an unseren Studienanstalten methodisch und systematisch betrieben werden?* [@zettel1882]. He argues that *Satzbilder* are quite useful in school, as they can readily be displayed on the blackboard [@zettel1882: 85-87]. His graphics look like those of Götzinger (see [@sec:götzinger1836]), although Zettel uses superscript numbers to indicate the parts of a clause that are separated by other clauses. Also telling is his example sentence [@next], which is a reformulation of the example given by Bauer (see [@fig:bauer1850_97]).

::: ex

It seems like the placement of the main clause capital *B* (*stellte ich ihm frei*) is a printing error. It should probably be placed at the top, aligned with the capital *A* main clause (*ich schenkte ihm 300 Rubel*).

### Kern (1883) *Methodik des deutschen Unterrichts* {#sec:kern1883}

Franz Kern (1830-1894) was a teacher and school director in Stettin (Szczecin) and Berlin. Most of his writings are literary commentaries for use in schools, but after his hiring in Berlin in 1881 he published various books on graphical methods for grammatical education. In the following decades, these proposals were discussed extensively in committees dealing with reforming the school curriculum, but in the end the decision went against Kern's graphical method. More details on Kern's life, his linguistic work and his impact can be found in Keinasto [-@keinasto2001; see also @osborne2020].

Starting in 1883, Kern published four books in quick succession. The first two were written for more learned readers, including teachers, the second two were written for a broader audience, including students. In accordance with the typesetting tradition at the time, the first two were printed in an *Antiqua*-typeface, in contrast to the later two, which were printed in a *Fraktur*-typeface:

- *Die deutsche Satzlehre: eine Untersuchung ihrer Grundlagen* [@kern1883a]. In this book Kern describes the general background and his theoretical approach to grammatical analysis. It was finished in 1882 before the following book was written.
- *Zur Methodik des deutschen Unterrichts* [@kern1883]. This book contains practical examples of how the graphical approach to grammatical education might work. This book is directed to teachers, not to students. Only the first quarter of the book is about graphical methods [@kern1883: 1-34], the rest deals with using literary examples in class.
- *Grundriss der deutschen Satzlehre* [@kern1884]. This book is a much more complete grammar of the German language, though restricted to syntax. It is conceived of as an introductory text for use in class. It includes graphical analyses [@kern1884: 30-36, 56-57], but only as a small addition to the detailed syntactic descriptions of German sentence structure.
- *Leitfaden für den Anfangsunterricht in der deutschen Grammatik* [@kern1888a]. This book is intended as a description of the lessons to be used in classes for younger students than the previous *Grundriss*, roughly for children aged 10-12 years old ("*bis Quinta einschließlich*"). Many examples of the graphical analysis are the same as in the *Grundriss*. A few simple introductory examples are newly addeed [@kern1888a: 59-60, 67-70].

For his graphical approach Kern uses line diagrams. This approach is very likely inspired by Hoffmann (see [@sec:hoffmann1839]), whose grammar is cited positively at various times in Kern's work [@kern1883: 57; @kern1888: 74, 156-159]. As an example of Kern's approach, his analysis of the sentence in [@next] is shown in [@fig:kern1883_17]. These kind of line diagrams are already described in words in the *Satzlehre* [@kern1883a: 110], but the first actual examples are given in the *Methodik* [@kern1883: 1-34]. In his graphical analysis, Kern only deals with the dependency structure and he almost completely ignores the actual ordering of the words in the sentence. The left-right ordering of the dependents is always subject-object-adverbial, irrespective of their ordering in the sentence. Such a fixed functional ordering is reminiscent of the approach by Moritz (see [@sec:moritz1782]), although there is no indication of any direct influence from Moritz on Kern. A completely new aspect of Kern's diagrams is the sole placement of the finite verb on top. Earlier diagrams by other scholars always placed both the subject and the verb on top.

::: ex
Als sie nun in ihrem neuen Glanze da stand, kamen die Sperlinge wieder, ihre alten Wohnungen zu suchen. [@kern1883: 13]
:::

::: {.im #kern1883_17}
*Schema* for the examples sentence in [@last] from Kern [-@kern1883: 17]. The ordering of the words in the actual sentence is not reflected in this diagram, only the dependency structure. Kern chose to put the finite verb on top as the principal governor of clause structure. Up to this point in time all analyses of other authors had the subject and the finite verb as co-equal elements on top of the graphical display. Also note the placement of the subordinating conjunction *als* as a relator on the connecting line, not as a separate node in the graph. Kern does not return to this idea in later analyses.
:::

Kern calls his graphical display a *Schema* and at various times he compares it to a tree [@kern1883: iv-v, footnote; -@kern1883a: 93, 95-96]. He even explicitly discusses the option to draw the *Schema* from bottom to top, like a real tree, but decides against this display for practical reasons. Also note that in the following quotation Kern talks about *dem gewöhnlichen Schema* 'the usual schema', probably referring to other authors, like Hoffmann, who also use a display with modifying words positioned downwards.

> Richtiger und anschaulicher (dem Bilde des Baumes entsprechend)
wäre vielleicht das umgekehrte Schema, so daß das finite Verbum unten stände, und die verschiedenen Bestimmungen sich als Verästelungen und Verzweigungen darstellten; doch habe ich es nicht gewählt, weil erstens in der praktischen Durchführung die Vorausberechnung des nötigen Raumes dem Schüler Schwierigkeiten machen würde, und zweitens der herkömmliche Terminus Abhängigkeit zu dem gewöhnlichen Schema besser paßt. [@kern1883: iv-v, footnote]
>
> ('The reverse schema would maybe have been more correct and more vivid (corresponding to the image of a tree), in such a way that the finite verb would be placed at the bottom and the various modifiers would be portrayed as branches; however, I did not choose this option because, first, in the practical application the student would have had difficulties with the planning of the required space, and second, the conventional term "dependency" (*Abhängigkeit*) fits better to the usual schema.')

As for the placement of the subject, in the *Satzlehre* [@kern1883a: 30-63] Kern spends many pages on the definition of the notion "subject". He basically concludes that the subject is somehow special, but that it still depends on the finite verb just like other constituents: *[Das Subjektswort im Nominativ] regiert nicht das finite Verbum, aber er ist seine allernächste Bestimmung* '[The subject in the nominative] does not govern the finite verb, but it is its closest modifier' [@kern1883a: 46]. Interestingly, when he explains his idea about drawing pictures, he uses a *Konjunktiv* when discussing the placement of the subject in the graphic (see quote below). This indicates that in late 1882, when he wrote the *Satzlehre*, he was not yet completely sure about the placement of the subject: either besides the finite verb (just like Hoffmann, see [@sec:hoffmann1839]), or below the finite verb (which he chose eventually). Notably, this *Konjunktiv* is changed to a regular indicative in the second edition of the *Satzlehre* [@kern1888: 177], as by then he is committed to the finite verb as the sole head of the clause with the subject placed below it. A verb-centric display was already used ten years earlier by Brassai (cf. [@sec:brassai1873]), but there is no direct evidence of any influence from Brassai on Kern. Still, Kern's graphics are eerily similar to Brassai's.

> Dem Sachverhalt noch entsprechender freilich wäre es, wenn oben ganz allein stets Verbum finitum stände und auch das Subjektswort am Ende eines nach links unten geführten Striches stände als die Verbalperson bestimmend. [@kern1883a: 110] 
>
> ('It would be even more in accordance to the issue, if the finite verb would be placed alone on top and the subject would also be placed at the end of a line going down left as the determiner of the verbal person.')

With simple examples, Kern's approach is a real step forward. However, the more examples he discusses, the more confusing his whole systems becomes. The first problematic aspect is that in the *Grundriss* [@kern1884] he starts leaving out the actual words in his schemas. He mostly just displays the grammatical categories, using constantly changing abbreviations. Such an "empty" schema is called a *Satzbild* [@kern1884: 30, footnote]. It is left up to the reader to reconstruct which abbreviations in the graphic display correspond to which words in the example sentence. This task is often non-trivial, because the ordering in the *Schema* does not necessarily represent the order in the sentence.

Second, Kern starts to use dotted lines without any explanation. At first this seems to be restriced to coordination [@kern1884: 31], but then he also uses dotted lines to indicate levels of embedding in complex sentences [@kern1884: 56]. In the *Leitfaden* [@kern1888a] he starts using dotted lines everywhere between the levels of modification. Instead of clarifying the structure, these dotted lines are mostly just adding confusion.

Third, for the analysis of complex sentences with many subordinated clauses, Kern introduces additional square brackets and round brackets, as shown in [@fig:kern1884_56] [@kern1884: 56-57]. This graphic is extremely confusing and it indicates that Kern's approach reaches its limits with more complex sentences. This graphic is an analysis of the complex sentences in [@next].

This graphical display is actually extremely confusing – and even Kern himself has missed a printing error with the square brackets on level 2: they should surround the first and the second element, not the second and the third. 
:::

Instead of visualising all modifications in all clauses, The display in [@fig:kern1884_56] focusses on the relationship between the various subordinate clauses, similar to the tradition of the *Periodenbilder*. Unfortunately, Kern also includes some non-clausal constituents, but not all. For example, the head nouns of relative clauses are included. These few non-clausal constituents are placed inside round brackets and these elements in round brackets then are linked to other parts of their subordinate sentence by using square brackets. 

The result is confusing enough that even Kern himself missed a printing error in this graphic (from the text it is clear he correctly understood the sentence structure): on subordination level 2 *(N-S. 2)* the element *Präd.꞊N* (=predicative nominative) belongs to the *Attr.꞊S.* (=attributive clause) to its left *(der mir so wert und teuer ist)*, not to the one on its right *(die ihn bedrängte)*. So, the square brackets should have been placed around the first and the second element, not around the second and the third.

The graphical analysis would have been much more transparent when only the subordinate clauses would have been shown. The internal structure of each of these clauses could, for example, have been explained separately as individual schemes. [@fig:kern1884_56_tree] shows an attempt to "clean up" Kern's analysis from [@fig:kern1884_56].

::: {.tree #kern1884_56_tree}
Simplified *Schema* of [@fig:kern1884_56], obtained by removing everything in round brackets (and fixing the square-bracket error mentioned above). The result only includes the hierarchical clause structure. Each of these clauses of course has its own internal structure, that each could be expanded using Kern's approach.
:::

Kern himself also realised that his system was not ideal for large sentences with many subordinate clauses. Consequently, he added the option for a simplified *Satzbild* only consisting of letters and numbers, like the many proposals of *Periodenbilder* ever since Herling. His simplified analysis for [@last] is shown in [@fig:kern1884_57]. It is a very simple one-line *Periodenbild* with a completely idiosyncratic use of letters and numbers. The dots separate the clauses. Each subordinate clause is represented by a number, which indicates the depth of the embedding. Lower-case letters *a, b* are used to indicate that a clause is separated by other clauses, so e.g. all parts labelled *1a* are parts of the same subordinate clause. Oddly, the two parts of the main clause, labeled *H (=Hauptsatz)*, are not marked in this way, probably because Kern assumes there to be only a single main clause in such a simplified analysis.

::: {.im #kern1884_57}
Simplified analysis of the example sentence in [@last] from Kern [-@kern1884: 57]. This display shows the actual order of the clauses from left to right. The number indicates the level of subordination of the clause, with *H* being used for *Hauptsatz* 'main clause'. The lower-case letters *a, b* indicate that a subordinate clause is interrupted by other subordinate clauses. Such a bare-bones one-line *Periodenbild* is reminiscent of Hoffmann's approach (see [@sec:hoffmann1839]).
:::

Finally, the following two details from Kern's descriptions suggest influences that might have led Kern to his particular graphical approach. First, he argues against the term *Erweiterung* with an argumentation that is eerily similar to the one made by Diesterweg as discussed in [@sec:diesterweg1830] [@diesterweg1830: 167; -@diesterweg1834: 151]. So maybe Kern knew about Diesterweg's approach, although there is no other concrete evidence for this.

> Uebrigens besagt der Ausdruck Satzerweiterung gar nichts als Satzverlängerung; denn durch hinzugefügte Bestimmungen wird der Inhalt des Satzes natürlich nicht erweitert, sondern verengert und dadurch bereichert. [@kern1883: 5, footnote]
>
> ('Incidentally, the term *Satzerweiterung* 'sentence expansion' refers to nothing more than elongation of the sentence; however, by adding modifications the content of a sentence is not expanded, but narrowed and enriched in the process.')

Second, Kern does not like the notion of *bekleidetet* 'dressed' sentences. His argument is actually quite convincing: this metaphor suggest that parts of the sentence are like shirts or trousers, which is actually quite a strange metaphor. Yet, even more telling is Kern's mentioning of the alternative term *umkleidet*, which is a very specific term only used by Hoffmann [-@hoffmann1839: 146-148].

> Eine recht überflüssige doch weniger schädliche Terminologie, ist auch die des nackten und bekleideten (oder umkleideten) Satzes. … In dieser Terminologie wird es vorgezogen, die Bestimmungen, statt als Äste, Zweige und Blätter sich zu denken, sie sich lieber als Hemde, Rock und Weste vorzustellen. Ich finde dieses Bild weder treffend noch geschmackvoll. [@kern1883a: 95-96]
>
> ('A rather superfluous, though less harmfull terminology, is the one of *nackte* 'naked' and *bekleidete* 'dressed' (or *umkleidete* 'around-dressed') sentences. … In this terminology modifiers, instead of thinking about them as branches and leaves, are preferably imagined as shirt, skirt and waistcoat. I consider this image to be neither fitting nor tasteful.')

### Müllener (1885) *Praktische Übungsschule* {#sec:müllener1885}

Christian Müllener wrote a *Praktische Übungsschule in Sprachform und Satzbau* [@mullener1885]. In this book he identifies himself as a teacher in Münchenbuchsee, a small town near Bern in Switzerland. There used to be a teacher's seminary in Münchenbuchsee, so he might have been employed there. However, I have not been able to find any further information about his biography.

In the *Praktische Übungsschule* Müllener uses *Satzbilder* to illustrate the relation between clauses in complex sentences [@mullener1885: 144-145]. He presents two options to depict the structure of a complex sentence. First, he proposes to write the different clauses in the order of occurrence in the sentence, but shift them downwards when they are subordinated, alike to the music-score approach. An example is shown in [@fig:müllener1885_145] for the examples sentence in [@next].

::: ex
Was du nicht willst, das man dir tu, das füg' auch keinem andern zu.
:::

::: {.im #müllener1885_145}
Basic analysis of a complex sentence structure for the example [@last] by using the vertical dimension to indicate subordination, from Müllener [-@mullener1885: 145]. The third clause of the sentence is the main clause (top), the first clause is subordinate to the main clause (mid), while the middle clause is subordinate to the first clause (bottom).
:::

Second, Müllener also proposes a symbolic representation of complex clauses in the tradition of Lehmann (see [@sec:lehmann1833]), as shown to the right in [@fig:müllener1885_151]. An explanation of the symbols is given in an appendix [@mullener1885: 167-168]:

- Roman numerals for main clauses, numbered according to the order of occurence.
- The relation between main clauses is indicated by the following symbols:
  - plus for coordination (*zusammenstellendes Satzverhältnis*)
  - dash for contradiction (*entgegenstellendes Satzverhältnis*)
  - semicolon for explanation (*begründetes Satzverhältnis*)^[There appears to be a typographic error on Müllener [-@mullener1885: 168], where a colon is shown for explanatory coordination, instead of a semicolon, which is used in the examples throughout the book. The colon is used for preposed clauses, in the tradition of Lehmann [-@lehmann1833].]
  - arch below for reduced coordination (*Zusammenziehung*)
- Subordinate clauses are indicated by lowercase abbreviations based on latin names for the clause-type:
  - *s* for subject clause
  - *a* for attributive/relative clause
  - *p* for predicative clause
  - *al* for local adverbial clause
  - *at* for temporal adverbial clause
  - *am* for manner adverbial clause
  - *ac* for causal adverbial clause
- Non-finite subordinate clauses are indicated by a circumflex.
- the position of the subordinate clause is identified according to the proposals by Lehmann [-@lehmann1833]:
  - initial subordinate clauses are separated by a colon
  - internal subordinate clauses are enclosed in round brackets
  - postposed subordinate clauses are written below the matrix clauses separated by a horizontal line (instead of the horizontal brace used by Lehmann)

Müllener provides two pages with exercised in which the students have to construct a complex sentence on the basis of the individual clauses and a given schema [@mullener1885: 150-152]. An example of such an exercise is shown in [@fig:müllener1885_151] for the example sentence [@next]. Note that there appears to be a typo in the symbolic representation: The three main clauses should all be linked by a connector-symbol, so it seems like the plus symbol is placed erroneously. The intended structure seems to have been I;II+III instead of the printed I;+II III. The example sentence appears to originate from a story about Demostehenes that appeared in a reader that was widespread in Switzerland.^[For example, a much later example can be found here <https://doi.org/10.3931/e-rara-89949>.]

::: ex

This example is given as an exercise, in which the students have to construct the complex sentence from the separate clauses (shown on the left), applying the subordination structure as given by the symbolic representation to the right.

### Willomitzer (1885) *Deutsche Grammatik* {#sec:willomitzer1885}

Franz Willomitzer (1847-1910) was a teacher for German language and history in Vienna, Austria. His book *Deutsche Grammatik für österreichische Mittelschulen* first appeared in 1879 and was revised and reprinted many times up to a 23th edition in 1930. After the death of Willomitzer the book was further developed by Johann Tschinkel. He renamed the book to *Deutsche Sprachlehre für Mittelschulen* and strongly reduced the number of visualisations, with eventually only a single unexplained graphic remaining [@tschinkel1921: 242].

In the first edition Willomitzer uses a numbered table to analyse a sentence, in the style of Becker (see [@sec:becker1829]). The analysis of the sentence *Finsternis bedeckt die Erde* 'darkness envelops the earth' is shown in [@fig:willomitzer1879_123] [@willomitzer1879: 123]. Just like Becker, Willomitzer uses reference to the row-numbers to clarify the dependency structure. However, different from Becker, Willomitzer does not add any dependency between subject and predicate (similar to Fürg, see [@sec:fürg1847]). Unfortunately, this example sentence is actually way too simple to really clarify the intentions of Willomitzer, and there are no other, more complex examples presented of this analytic approach. Exactly the same figure is repeated in later editions [@willomitzer1882: 109; -@willomitzer1885: 122; -@willomitzer1894: 113].

::: {.im #willomitzer1879_123}
Numbered table in the style of Becker (cf. [@fig:becker1829_xvii]) from Willomitzer [@willomitzer1879: 123]. Willomitzer also applies Becker's idea of using the numbers to identify the dependency between words. Unfortunately, this example is extremely simple. Willomitzer does not present any other examples to illustruate how this system should be applied to more complex sentences.
:::

For sentences with multiple subordination like in [@next] Willomitzer uses a different visualisation as shown in [@fig:willomitzer1879_157] [@willomitzer1879: 157-158]. Each clause is indicated by a horizontal line with a letter, and these clauses are connected by slanted lines. A line left-downwards indicates a preposed subordinate clauses, while slanted lines right-downwards indicate postposed subordination. Internal subordination, like with relative clauses, is not discussed. Exactly the same visualisation is also used in the fourth edition [@willomitzer1882: 144-145].

::: ex
- Als Karl der Große den Kaiserstuhl Roms bestieg, war ein Ziel erreicht, dem hochstrebenden deutschen Fürsten seit Jahrhunderten nachgetrachtet haben.
- Nur der ist unser Wahrer Freund, der mit uns gleiche Bestrebungen teilt und auf den wir uns in guten und bösen Tagen verlassen können.
- Ich erinnere mich, dass wir in einem alten Haus wohnten, welches eigentlich aus zwei durchbrochenen Häusern bestand.
:::

::: {.im #willomitzer1879_157}
Visualisations of multiple subordinated constructions from Willomitzer [-@willomitzer1879: 157-58]. From left to right these displays illustrate the structures of the example sentences in [@last]: (a) one subordination before and one subordination after the main clause, (b) a coordination inside a postposed subordinate clause, (c) a postposed subordination embedded inside another postposed subordination.
:::

There are a few interesting changes in the sixth edition [@willomitzer1894: 154-156]. First, Willomitzer adds a "plus" symbol for coordination instead of the dotted connection in the middle image of [@fig:willomitzer1879_157]. Second, he adds one-line *Periodenbilder* as an additional option, although he does not explain this method at all. He simply adds abbreviations to the end of a few examples sentences, as shown in [@fig:willomitzer1894_156]. The format of these abbreviations is similar to other approaches before him, except for the use of the colon and the forward slash. Willomitzer reverses the use of the colon and the forward slash in comparison to e.g. Nägelsbach (cf. [@fig:nägelsbach1846_286]). Willomitzer uses the forward slash to separate preposed subordination, while the colon separates postposed subordination.

::: {.im #willomitzer1894_156}
Example sentence with a one-line *Periodenbild* add to the end, from the sixth edition of Willomitzer [-@willomitzer1894: 156]. He reverses the use of the colon and the forward slash in comparison to e.g. Nägelsbach (cf. [@fig:nägelsbach1846_286]). In this analysis from Willomitzer, the forward slash separates preposed subordination, while the colon separates postposed subordination. Internal subordination is indicate with round brackets, a tradition going back to Lehmann (1833), see [@fig:lehmann1833_58].
:::

Willomitzer adds a new kind of graphical display in the revision between the third edition [@willomitzer1882] and the fourth edition [@willomitzer1885]. In this timeframe Kern published his new graphical approach (see [@sec:kern1883]) and Willomitzer immediately includes Kern's approach in his fourth edition, though without explicit attribution [@willomitzer1885: 123, 132, 137]. The examples below are cited from the almost identical sixth edition because of the better quality of the available scans [@willomitzer1894: 114, 121, 127]. The analysis of the first example [@next a] is shown in [@fig:willomitzer1894_114]. This graphical display is much clearer than the examples from Kern, mostly because Willomitzer does not use any abbreviations. The analysis of [@next b] is shown in [@fig:willomitzer1894_127]. This is an example with a subordinate clause, in which the complementizer *dass* is not a node in the graph, but a relation between nodes, an approach also used by Kern.

::: ex

Analysis of a monoclausal sentence [@last a] from Willomitzer [-@willomitzer1885: 123;-@willomitzer1894: 114] in the style of Kern (cf. [@fig:kern1883_17]). Within two years after the release of Kern [-@kern1883], Willomitzer uses exactly this approach in the revision of his *Deutsche Grammatik*. This graphic is actually much clearer than Kern's because Willomitzer does not use abbreviations. The analysis is still slightly confusing because the ordering of the actual sentence is not represented in the graphical display.
:::

Analysis of a complex sentence with subordination [@last b] from Willomitzer [-@willomitzer1894: 127] in the style of Kern (cf. [@fig:kern1884_56]). Again, Willomitzer's graphic is much cleaner and easier to understand than Kern's original. Just like Kern, the complementizer *dass* is not a node in itself, but a relation. 
:::

### Lyon (1885) *Handbuch der deutschen Sprache* {#sec:lyon1885}

Otto Lyon (1853-1912) was a teacher and *Stadtschulrat* in Dresden [biographical details in @kolb1987]. He was an extremely productive author, revising and reissuing classical linguistic works of the likes of Heyse, Becker and Eberhard, editing an anthology of German literature for use in schools, and producing a textbook for teaching all aspects of German. He also co-founded the journal *Zeitschrift für den deutschen Unterricht*.

His textbook *Handbuch der deutschen Sprache für höhere Schulen* was originally published in 1885. There have been many different versions of this handbook. I have counted at least 36 editions among seven different variants, some having multiple volumes, including six different co-authors. These books are often indexed incompletely or wrongly in catalogues, so it takes some effort to identify which version is available at any library. I have tried to reconstruct the editorial developments, but this edition-mess is in need of a more proper clean-up. Different variants of the handbook were introduced starting with the sixth edition in 1902.^[The second volume of Lyon's original sixth edition from 1902 is available online at <https://google.com/books?id=ZQkYT08lhVYC>.] A distinction into four different versions was made, which are sometimes (but not always) indicated by the letters A through D. I will use these letters as a shortcut to identify the different versions, and I will add a subscript for major revisions of the C and D variants.

- **A-variant**: The original handbook written by Otto Lyon is spread out over two volumes and separates the topics by schoolyear. The majority of the grammatical analysis is included in the first volume, which was written for the lower classes of secondary education (*untere und mittlere Klassen, Sexta bis Tertia).* This first volume will be cited here from the second edition [@lyon1889] because I have not been able to find a first edition. Lyon has updated his handbook up to a seventh edition in 1907.^[The second volume of Lyon's original seventh edition from 1907 is available online at <https://google.com/books?vid=OSU:32435022678213>.]
- **B-variant**: This is the same A-variant, but published as smaller booklets. It appears that the first volume was subdivided into four booklets and the second volums into three booklets. I have not been able to access this version.
- **C~1~-variant**: A special summary version for teachers. This version started a new edition count. The first edition was prepared together with Paul Polack under the name *Handbuch der deutschen Sprache für Präparandenanstalten und Seminare* [@lyon1902] and saw at least five editions.
- **C~2~-variant**: Sometime after the 5th edition from 1910 the further development of the C-variant was taken over by Albert Sieke und Richard Reißig under the name *Otto Lyons Handbuch der deutschen Sprache für Lehrerbildungsanstalten*, cited here in the 8th edition from 1919 [@lyon1919], which was published as two volumes with continuously numbered pages. The grammatical analysis can be found in the first volume.
- **D~1~-variant**: A version of the A-variant tailored for use in Prussian schools, adding a subtitle *für preußische höhere Schulen*. This version also started a new edition count. The first edition of this version was prepared together with Willy Scheel. It will be cited here from the 6th edition from 1911 [@lyon1911]. 
- **D~2~-variant**: Starting with the 12th edition from 1914, the further development of the D-variant was taken over by Curt Müller and Alfred Roedel under the name *Otto Lyons Handbuch der deutschen Sprache für höhere Schulen mit Übungsaufgaben*, cited here from the 16th edition from 1920 [@lyon1920].
- **Abriß**: There is also a summarised version called *Abriß der deutschen Grammatik und kurze Geschichte der deutschen Sprache* [@lyon1891]. This variant does not include any graphical analyses and will not be further discussed here.

Already in the first edition, Lyon proposes a set of abbreviations for different syntactic functions within the clause [@lyon1889: 99-100]. Unfortunately, these abbreviations are completely opaque and they have almost no mnemonic value. For example, subject is called "I", the predicate is "II", the direct object is "IIIa", a causal adverbial is "IVd", etc. These abbreviations are used to analyse a sentence. The example sentence [@next] is used in almost all variants to illustrate the process. The names for these methods and their details differ between the variants, as shown in [@fig:lyon1889_101] for the A and the D~1~ variant (called *Satzanalyse*), [@fig:lyon1920_87] for the D~2~-variant (called *schriftliche Satzzerlegung*) and [@fig:lyon1902_32] for the C~1~-variant (called *Satzbild*).

::: ex

:::

::: {.im #lyon1889_101}
*Satzanalyse* of the example sentence in [@last] from the A-variant [@lyon1889: 101]. Exactly the same analysis, but with roman numerals, is found in the D~1~-variant [@lyon1911: 88]. In total Lyon distinguishes 10 different syntactic functions, which are all indicated by a totally non-transparent alphanumeric code.
:::

::: {.im #lyon1920_87}
*Schriftliche Satzzerlegung* of the sentence in [@last] from the D~2~-version [@lyon1920: 87]. The abbreviations are replaced with slightly more mnemonic letter-sequences. The new abbreviations are introduced already starting on page four of the book, so it is considered to be a fundamental aspect of linguistic analysis by the authors. Different from Lyon's original approach, these abbreviations are a mix of word classes and syntactic functions. The capitals indicate the syntactic function, the lower-case letters the word class, e.g. *s.O.=substantivisches Objekt*, *part.A.=partizipiales Attribut*, etc.
:::

::: {.im #lyon1902_32}
*Satzbild* of the sentence in [@last] from the C~1~-version [@lyon1902: 32], analysing the sentence as GAUB͜EUE (broad version), GAU~o~B͜E~3~U~w~E~4~ (detailed version), or as SPA~v~A͜OA~v~O (version with Latin abbreviations). The use of letters is slightly more memorable than the alphanumeric codes. Also note the little arc below the letters indicating that the combination of attributive adjective and noun (*bittende Maus*) should be considered as a single constituent.
:::

New graphical approaches were introduced in the 1910s, both in the C~2~ and in the D~2~ variants. Both variants introduce line diagrams, but with some interesting differences. The D~2~-variant introduces a verb-centric diagram as shown for example [@next a] in [@fig:lyon1920_157]. This graphic is very similar to Kern's approach (see [@sec:kern1883]). Kern is not explicitly mentioned, but in the preface the authors mention that: *wir [sind] wie die meisten neueren Sprachmethodiker vom Prädikat ausgegangen* 'just like most newer linguistic methods, we started with the predicate' [@lyon1920: iii].

The line diagram in the C~2~-variant does not have a verb-centric approach, but instead places subject and finite verb equally on top, cf. [@fig:lyon1919_122] for the example sentence [@next b]. Both the C~2~ and the D~2~-variant add syntactic labels to all words in the line diagrams. In both cases, these labels are abbreviations that consists of two parts: an indication of word class with a lower-case letter and a symbol for the syntactic function using capitalised abbreviations. However, the naming conventions are completely different as explained in the figure-captions.

::: ex

Unnamed graphic for the examples sentence in [@last a] from the D~2~-version [@lyon1920: 157]. The verb-centric display is very similar to Kern's approach (cf. [@fig:kern1883_17]). The abbrevations for syntactic functions are the same as in [@fig:lyon1920_87] above, e.g. *v.P.=verbales Prädikat*, *s.S.=substantivisches Subjekt*, etc.
:::

::: {.im #lyon1919_122}
Unnamed graphic for the example sentence in [@last b] from the C~2~-version [@lyon1919: 122]. Different from the previous D~2~-variant, this display has subject and predicate equally on top. However, similar to the D~2~-variant the abbreviations also consist of two parts, the lower-case letter indicates the word class *(d=Dingwort, e=Eigenschaftswort, z=Zeitwort, m=Mittelwort)* and the capitalised abbreviations indicate syntactic function *(Sg.=Satzgegenstand, Sa.=Satzaussage, Erg.=Ergänzung, Bf.=Beifügung, Ub.=Umstandsbestimmung).* The number four refers to the accusative case.
:::

In the C~2~-variant there is a fascinating application of the line diagram to explain a syntactic detail of German [@lyon1919: 136]. The authors observe that with the *lassen+Infinitiv* and the *heißen+Infinitiv* construction in German there is a crucial difference between using an accusative or a dative. Their examples are repeated here in [@next] with the crucial parts italicised. When accusative, the participant is the patient of the finite verb *lassen/heißen*, while when dative, this participant is the recipient of the infinitive verb *vorlesen/bringen*. This difference is illustrated by the contrasting graphical syntactic analyses in [@fig:lyon1919_136].

::: ex

  Mein Freund ließ *mir*~~​~DAT~​~~ die Zeitung vorlesen.

:::

::: {.im #lyon1919_136}
Application of diagrams from the C~2~-variant [@lyon1919: 136] to explain the difference between the use of the accusative or dative in the examples in [@last]. The leftmost diagrams illustrate the use of the accusative, which is an argument to the finite verb *ließ/hieß*. The rightmost diagrams show that the dative is a recipient of the verb in the infinitive *vorlesen/bringen*. The use of the large braces in the leftmost diagrams is confusing. It would have been clearer to use slanted lines here as well.
:::

Separate from the clause-internal analysis, Lyon also discusses *Satzbilder* in the tradition of Lehmann (see [@sec:lehmann1833]) for sentences consisting of multiple clauses. Lyon presents a very short one-page summary of his notational variant [@lyon1889: 269-270]. He uses different lower-case letters for different kinds of subordinate clauses (*a*=complement clause, *b*=relative clause, *c*=adverbial clause), round brackets for non-finite clauses and superscript numbers for levels of embedding. The punctuation of the original sentence is repeated verbatim in the *Satzbild*. As an example he presents the graphical analysis in [@fig:lyon1889_270] for the sentence from Schiller in [@next].

Exactly the same explanations and examples are found in the D~1~-variant [@lyon1911: 164-165], the D~2~-variant [@lyon1920: 268] and the C~2~-variant [@lyon1919: 197-198]. Only in the C~1~-variant  there is a short note offering an alternative notation [@lyon1902: 154-156]. In this variation, a superscript *v* is used for non-finite clauses (cf. Gelbe, [@sec:gelbe1877]) and a fractional number is used for parts of clauses that are separated by another clause (cf. Herling, [@sec:herling1823]).

The lower-case letters for subordinated clauses indicate the kind of clause (here: *c*=adverbial clause), the round brackets indicate non-finite clauses (here: *um zu+Infinitiv*) and the superscript numbers indicate the level of embedding.
:::

Lyon also wrote a separate series of anthologies of German literature called *Die Lektüre als Grundlage eines einheitlichen und naturgemäßen Unterrichtes in der deutschen Sprache*. In volume 2, part 1 (for *Obertertia*, i.e roughly for teenagers of age 15) there is an extensive discussion of the use of these *Satzbilder* with numerous examples [@lyon1897: 130-154]. To finish the discussion of Otto Lyon's graphical analysis, I have repeated here in [@next] one of Lyon's examples from Lessing with the corresponding *Satzbild* in [@fig:lyon1897_140]. The reader is invited to follow along, just like the teenage students were supposed to do back at the later part of the 19th Century.

### Utzinger (1887) *Deutsche Grammatik* {#sec:utzinger1887}

Heinrich Utzinger (1842-1913) was a teacher and later schooldirector in Küsnacht, Switzerland. He wrote the book *Deutsche Grammatik: Lehr- und Übungsbuch für Sekundarschulen* [@utzinger1887], which was written on behalf of the kanton Zürich to be the official textbook for all secondary schools in the kanton. Utzinger himself delivered various editions during his lifetime, though with only minor changes. The book remained in print after his death up to a 14th edition in 1943. In the preface he mentions various grammars as influences, but none of those could have been the inspiration for his graphical display.

In the discussion of word order in the clause, Utzinger presents a single illustrative *Schema* for the example sentence in [@next] as shown in [@fig:utzinger1887_89] [@utzinger1887: 89]. The word *Schema* and the use of slanted lines might indicate an influence of Kern (see [@sec:kern1883]). However, Utzinger follows the old tradition in placing subject and predicate side-by-side on top of the graphical display. Because there is only a single example of this graphical approach, it remains unclear how Utzinger envisions the left-right ordering of modifiers to be used. Kern quite radically used a strict subject-object-adverbial order, but the single example from Utzinger does not clarify whether he would follow that approach.

*Schema* for the examples sentence in [@last] from Utzinger [-@utzinger1887: 89]. The visual impression of the display is reminiscent of Kern's approach (cf. [@fig:kern1883_17]), but Utzinger places subject and object side-by-side on top, just like in the original line-diagram from Billroth (cf. [@fig:billroth1832_102]).
:::

For the analysis of complex sentences with multiple subordinate clauses Utzinger proposes a different format [@utzinger1887: 122]. He uses a one-line summary, which he calls a *Satzbild*, as shown in [@fig:utzinger1887_122] for the examples sentence in [@next]. The depth of embedding is indicated by subscript numbers. Lower-case letters indicate subordinate clauses, but it remains unclear why the letters *a* and *b* are used multiple times in this example. In the example, the two parts marked *a~1~* are actually two separated parts of the same subordinate clause, but all other parts are separate clauses, and might better have been indicated by separate letters.

He follows the tradition to use capital letters for the main clause and lower-case letters for subordinate clauses. Depth of embedding is indicated by subscript numbers. It is actually unclear why only the lower-case letters *a* and *b* are used here. The two parts marked *a~1~* are two parts of the same clause, separated by a different clause marked *a~2~.* The two *b* clauses are different clauses. It seems more consistent to write: *a~1~ b~2~ a~1~ A c~1~ d~2~* or something like that.

### Kuderna (1895) *Das Satzbild in seiner Anwendung* {#sec:kuderna1985}

Béla Kuderna (1846-1915) was a captian (*Hauptmann*) in the Austrian army and teacher for German language and style at the *Infanterie-Cadetenschule* in Vienna, Austria. In 1893 he wrote a short article on teaching German, called *Sprachliches Mahnwort* [@kuderna1893]. This article includes two mostly unexplained examples of *Satzbilder* as he used them in his classes [@kuderna1893: 268-269]. Shortly afterwards he published a complete booklet about his approach to graphically analyse sentences, called *Das Satzbild in seiner Anwendung für die Lehre vom Satze* [@kuderna1895]. This book goes into great detail explaining his approach, including numerous practical examples.

As for the inspiration for his graphical approach, Kuderna mentions Bauer (see [@sec:bauer1850]) in passing [@kuderna1895: 4], but only to complain about Bauer's non-mnemonic usage of letters and symbols. For example, instead of using an abstract letter *A* for the main clause, Kuderna proposes to use the letter *H* as an abbreviation of the German word *Hauptsatz* 'main clause'. There are no further clear indications for specific influences. Kuderna uses line diagrams and letters with superscripts and subscripts, just like most other authors around this time. However, the combination of line-diagram with abbreviations as nodes is an idiosyncratic mixture of Kuderna. Subject and predicate are both placed on top, indicating a more traditional approach, not following Kern's verb-centric proposal (cf. [@sec:kern1883]).

Kuderna's *Satzbild* comes in two different variants, one for single clauses (using lower-case letters) and one for complex sentences consisting of multiple clauses (using capital letters). To explain his system, Kuderna presents the two example sentences in [@next], graphically analysed in [@fig:kuderna1895_6]. Sentence [@next a] is an example of a single clause and [@next b] is a complex sentence with multiple clauses. Kuderna's diagrams are shown to the left in [@fig:kuderna1895_6] (using letters). The diagrams to the right with the actual words are only added as explanation. This is the only time in the book that show the actual words, all other examples only have the abstract letters.

:::

Kuderna extols his own system because of the transparent usage of the letters (*s=Subjekt*, *a=Attribut*, *o=Objekt*, *H=Hauptsatz*, etc.). However, he complicates his analysis by adding superscripts and subscript, ending up with more than 50 different abbreviations [summarised in @kuderna1895: 10-11]. As a result, more involved examples very quickly become unwieldy and difficult to interpret. For example, the sentence in [@next] are analysed by Kuderna as shown in [@fig:kuderna1895_33] and [@fig:kuderna1895_52]. Instead of simplifying the interpretation of the sentence structure, these *Satzbilder* become puzzles in their own right.

:::

::: {.im #kuderna1895_52}
*Satzbild* for a complex clause with multiple subordinate clauses [@last b] from Kuderna [-@kuderna1895: 52]. The striked-through *N* indicates a non-finite *zu-Infinitiv* subordinate clause. The ordering of the subordinate clauses in the *Satzbild* is strictly left-to-right and top-to-bottom. However, Kuderna does not mark clause-internal subordination. This leads to clauses that are separated into multiple parts, and these impede the interpretation of a *Satzbild*.

### Trunk (1895) *Über Satzbilder* {#sec:trunk1895}

Hans Trunk (1847-1929) was a teacher and school director in Graz (Austria).^[I have not been able to find much biographical information about Hans Trunk. HathiTrust provides a birthyear (<https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/102143919>) and *Kürschners Deutscher Literatur-Kalender* (1930: 1524) lists his death, but without precise date (<https://doi.org/10.1515/9783112340301>).] Most of his writings deal with pedagogical methods. In this context he writes a small article *Über Satzbilder* [@trunk1895]. Much of the content of this article is also included in a more wide-ranging book about teaching German language *Zur Hebung des deutschen Sprachunterrichtes* [@trunk1898: 123-127]. 

Trunk's graphical analysis is inspired by Kern (see [@sec:kern1883]), who is explicitly cited [@trunk1895: 309; @trunk1898: 123]. Additionally, Trunk clearly knew about many other approaches as well, citing the historical survey of *Satzbilder* by Gelbe [-@gelbe1880]. However, Trunk complains about missing simplicity and clarity of all previous proposals for *Satzbilder*, so he devised his own variant. Although he mostly based his approach on Kern (using line-diagrams with the verb as the sole governor of the clause), he adds the requirement that all leaves of the graph should be placed in the order as they occur in the sentence [@trunk1895: 310]. Specifically, the direction of the slanted lines in this graphical display is meaningful: slanted down left means the element comes before its head, while slanted down right indicates placement after the head.

Just like Kern, Trunk uses code-letters in his graphical displays, which makes it actually quite hard to interpret them. This is particularly troubling when many elements with the same code co-occur in the analysis, as in [@fig:trunk1895_312] for sentence [@next a]. Observing this problem, Trunk suggests to write the words themselves on the board for clarity [@trunk1895: 314]. Also just like Kern, Trunk uses a different approach for sentences consisting of multiple clauses, as in [@fig:trunk1895_314] for sentence [@next b]. Here each letter indicates a clause, not an individual word.

::: ex
- Gestern schlug der Blitz in die alte Linde vor dem Hause unseres Nachbarns. [@trunk1895: 312] 
- Wenn dein Bruder, der mir so wert und teuer ist, wie nur irgend ein Mensch es sein kann, in der Not, die ihn bedrängte, sich an mich gewendet hätte, so würde ich, was nur irgend in meinen Kräften stand, aufgeboten haben, damit er damals die Ruhe, deren er so würdig ist, wieder gewonnen hätte.

:::

::: {.im #trunk1895_312}
Single-clause *Satzbild* for example sentence [@last a] from Trunk [-@trunk1895: 312]. Left-slanted lines indicate position before the head, while right-slanted lines are for elements that occur after their head. The many letters *B (=Beifügung)* are rather confusing because it is not immediately clear to which word they belong. The whole constituent marked *Uo* refers to the phrase: *in die alte* (=B left) *Linde* (=Uo) *vor dem Hause* (=B right top) *unseres* (=B right bottom) *Nachbarns* (=B right middle).

In this graphic, the direction of the slanted lines indicates position before of after the head. The curved lines between letters mark that this clause is interrupted by a subordinate clause. Following tradition, Trunk uses lower-case letter for subordinate clauses: *ug=Umstand des Grundes*, *uw=Umstand der Weise*, *e=Ergänzungs­satz*, *b=Beifügungssatz*.
:::

### Heric (1896) *Bemerkungen zu den Trunk'schen Satzbildern* {#sec:heric1896}

Matija (Matthias) Heric (1855-1927) was a teacher in Neukirchen (Novi Cerkvi) near Pettau (Ptuj) in the region Steiermark (today part of Slovenia). More biographical details are available in Šlebinger [-@slebinger1926]. He wrote a short article expanding upon Trunk's approach (see [@sec:trunk1895]), specifically discussion nominal predication. Heric used the same graphical approach also in a short article about his native Slovene, using the name *obrazec* 'formula' (plural *obrazci*) for the graphical display [@heric1897]. As an example of Heric's approach, the analysis for his examples in [@next] is shown in [@fig:heric1896_268].

::: ex

::: {.im #heric1896_268}
*Satzbilder* for the example sentences in [@last] from Herič [-@heric1896: 264]. He analyses the noun *Schneeglöckchen* as a predicative element, either in the nominative case as *Pn* [@last a] or the accusative case as *Pa* [@last b].  The finite verb is always the centre of the display, so in a passive senctence like [@last a] all arguments are attached to the finite auxiliary *wird* and the lexical verb *genannt* is linked to the auxiliary with an arch.

### Toifel (1896) *Satzstellung in der Kudrun* {#sec:toifel1896}

Otto Toifel (dates unknown) was a teacher in Austria, first in Salzburg and later in Ried im Innkreis. He wrote a few articles in which he applied Lehmann's graphical approach (see [@sec:lehmann1833]) to analyse examples from Middle High German literature. In particular, Toifel used one-line *Satzbilder* following Lehmann [-@lehmann1856], whom he explicitly cites. However, Toifel employs lower-case latin letters with superscript numbers for levels of subordination, instead of the different scripts used by Lehmann. 

Toifel applies this approach in two short articles to analyse "unusual" sentence structures in the German epic *Kudrun* [@toifel1896; @toifel1897]. A few years later he did the same for special constructions in texts by Bertold of Regensburg [@toifel1901]. An example of his analysis is the *Satzbild* shown in [@fig:toifel1896_19] for the quotation from the *Kudrun* in [@next]. The symbols in the example are not in Toifel's original, but added here for comparison with the *Satzbild*. An attempted English translation is given in [@nnext]. The special phenomenon highlighted by Toifel is the relative clause *b^3^*, which he analyses as a preposed relative clause, refering to *die* 'them' in the following clause *b^2^*.

In his graphical analysis, Toifel uses the colon in a special way. Lehmann originally used the colon only to indicate subordinate clauses that are preposed to the main clause (i.e. clauses in the German *Vorfeld* like *a^1^* ). Toifel additionally uses the colon for subordinate clauses that are preposed to another subordinate clause, which is a highly unusual structure in German. Specifically, the fact that clause *b^3^* is subordinated and preposed to clause *b^2^* is indicated by the colon between these clauses in [@fig:toifel1896_19].

::: ex
\(a^1^) und haete ich hundert swester, (A) die lieze ich sterben ê, \
(b^1^) dann ich mich alsô starke in vremeden landen haele, \

:::

::: {.im #toifel1896_19}
*Satzbild* for the example in [@llast] from Toifel [-@toifel1896: 19]. Toifel argues that the relative clause *b^3^* is actually a preposed relative clause, referring to *die* 'them' in the following clause *b^2^*. This special proposing is indicated by the colon betwen *b^3^* and *b^2^* in the figure.

### Stamm (1899) *Graphische Darstellung* {#sec:stamm1899}

Adolf Stamm (born 1857) was a teacher in Iserlohn and later a school director in Anklam and in Mülheim an der Ruhr.^[I have not been able to find more biographical information about him, except for the footnote on page 11 of this school report <https://nbn-resolving.org/urn:nbn:de:hbz:061:1-899851>. He is mentioned as the first director of the Gymnasium in Mülheim on <https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otto-Pankok-Schule>. Both websites accessed 9 January 2025.] He wrote a small booklet called *Graphische Darstellung der deutschen Satzlehre nebst einer Interpunktionslehre* [@stamm1899] in which he presents his own, completely idiosyncratic, system of graphical sentence analysis. The scholars who took notice of Stamm's work appear to be quite critical [@arens1902; @eberhard1905; @mossner1960], mostly because his images are too complex to be practical. Actually, Stamm's system of visual analysis is beautiful, well though-through and explained in much detail with very many examples. But indeed, it is not practical. It is very hard to remember what all symbols mean because they are completely arbitrary representations of linguistic structure. 

In the preface, Stamm mentions that the idea to use graphical display is not new, but he finds the other proposals not satisfying [@stamm1899: v]. He explicitly mentions the *Handbuch* of Lyon (see [@sec:lyon1885]), but at this point in time that *Handbuch* did not yet include graphical analyses. So it remains unclear what other graphical approaches have influenced Stamm.

Stamm proposes different systems for the analysis of single-clause sentences and for multi-clause complex sentences. The images for single-clause sentences at first seem reasonably easy to grasp, as illustrated here with example [@next a] displayed in [@fig:stamm1899_7]. They follow the traditional subject-predicate basis with various elements "growing" upwards out of this basis. However, there are different kinds of squiggly lines representing different kinds of structures, with numbers and letters arbitrary assigned to various functions. The same numbers even have different meanings depending upon which squiggly line they are used with.

For a multi-clause sentences *(Satzgefüge)* Stamm uses a variant of the music-score metaphor, illustrated here with example [@next b] displayed in [@fig:stamm1899_17]. The vertical line representes the main clause, and all subordinated clauses are indicated by horizontal lines, appearing in the order as they occur in the sentence. The height of the horizontal clauses represents the depth of the embedding. Different letters and dashes all have different meaning, which again are assigned completely arbitrarily. For example, the double dash for clause e^3̱̱^ indicates that it is a conditional clause, and the double vertical dashes with clauses d^2^ and e^4^ indicate that these are non-finite participle clauses.

However, the different squiggly lines on top are completely arbritrarily assigned.

The height of the horizontal lines indicates the depth of embedding. The letters, numbers and dashes are again completely arbritrarily assigned to specific grammatical structures.

### Jauker (1900) *Deutsche Sprachlehre*

Karl Jauker (1850-1924?) was director of the teacher's seminary in Graz, Austria.^[Karl Jauker is regularly included in the *Kürschners Deutscher Literatur-Kalender*. The last, very short, mention of is from 1924 (page 426) <https://doi.org/10.1515/9783111438030>. Afterwards he is removed, and there is no announcement of his passing.] He wrote a German textbook called *Deutsche Sprachlehre*, which appeared in various version for different audiences. I have been able to access the version *für österreichische Bürgerschulen* [@jauker1900] and the version *für Lehrer- und Lehrerinnen-Bildungsanstalten*. This second version was first published in 1904, but it is cited here from the third, mostly unchanged, edition [@jauker1910]. More in-depth research is needed to compare Jauker's various textbooks and their different editions.

The visual analysis of sentences, called *Zergliederung* or *Analyse*  [@jauker1900: 78-81, 108-111; @jauker1910: 96-99, 129-138] is clearly influenced by Trunk (see [@sec:trunk1895]), who also lived and worked in Graz. Jauker uses different visualisations for (i) the internal structure of single-clause sentences and (ii) the clausal hierarchical structure of multi-clause sentences. In both kinds of images he follows Trunk in including sentence ordering of a dependent in relation to its immediate head: lines going down-left means that the dependent is placed before its head, while lines going down-right indicate placement after the head.

Jauker's *Satzbild* for single-clause sentences is illustrated here in [@fig:jauker1900_80] for the example in [@next a], from the version *für österreichische Bürgerschulen* [@jauker1900: 80]. The different parts of the sentence are marked with abbreviations for syntactic functions. The placement of the consituents follow the ordering of the sentence, except for the attributive modifiers, called *Beif=Beifügung*, which are placed exactly below their heads. A few years later, in the version *für Lehrer- und Lehrerinnen-Bildungsanstalten* [@jauker1910], there are two minor changes to this display. First, as shown in [@fig:jauker1910_98] for the example [@next b], the figure only includes the functional abbreviations, so it is not immediately obvious how this figure relates to the example sentence (this was earlier presented as an alternative option). Additionally, the attributive modifiers *Beif=Beifügung* are now placed in such a way as to indicate their ordering relative to their heads..

Because of the omission of the actual words in [@fig:jauker1910_98], it becomes a syntactic exercise to related the figure tot the actual example. In this figure, the clause is headed by the finite verb *stand* 'stood', which is indicated as *Ausſag. Ztw.=aussagendes Zeitwort*. Relative to this verb, there is one line going down-left to the preposed adverbial phrase headed by *Stelle* 'place', which is indicated as *U.d.O.=Umstand des Ortes*. To the right is the postposed subject *Menge* 'large number', which is indicated by *Subjw=Subjektwort*. Both the adverbial phrase and the subject have various attributive modifiers, called *Beif=Beifügung*.

It can be seen as an exercise in syntactic analysis to find out why this figure is actually a representation of the structure of [@last b]. The placement of the modifiers *Beif=Beifügung* now also shows their ordering, different from the earlier version in [@fig:jauker1900_80]
:::

The *Satzbild* for a multi-clause sentence only indicates the various clauses in the graphic, as illustrated in [@fig:jauker1900_110] for the sentence [@next a] and in the highly similar [@fig:jauker1910_131] for the sentence [@next b]. These examples come from different versions and use different example sentences, but they have almost the same structure. Probably Jauker changed the example to appeal to the audience of these books, the first being for *Bürgerschulen*, the second for the students at his teacher's seminary.

The capital letter *H* indicates the main clause, while subordinated clauses are indicated by lower-case letters. The depth of embedding is indicated by superscript numbers. The rounded arches indicate that the linked abbreviations are actually two parts of the same clause, interrupted by a subordinate clause. There are various different abbreviations for the syntactic function of the subordinate clause in these figures, e.g. a manner adverbial clause *uw=Umstand der Weise*, a causal adverbial clause *ug=Umstand des Grundes*, an object clause *o=Objektsatz*, various relative clauses *b=Beifügungssatz*. The round brackets for the clause *(ug^1^)* indicate that this clause is non-finite.

### Raumer (1902) *Das Periodenbild* {#sec:raumer1902}

Siegmund von Raumer (1860-1939) was a teacher in Erlangen. He wrote a short article about *Periodenbilder* complaining about their complexity and unsuitability for usage in education. He is particularly critical of Kern (cf. [@sec:kern1883]), discussing the example shown earlier in [@fig:kern1884_56]. Just like Kern himself, Raumer also misses that there is an error in that graphic. 

As a summary of his criticism Raumer presents various renditions of *Periodenbilder* for the same complex sentence, repeated here in [@next]. Two different proposals by Kern are illustrated, alongside displays in the style of Nägelsbach (cf. [@sec:nägelsbach1846]) and Götzinger (cf. [@sec:götzinger1836]). I have not been able to find the source of proposal number (3) in [@fig:raumer1902_63]. There is no citation in the article itself, and none of the proposals currently discussed in this book look like this *Periodenbild*.

The last proposal (6) is the one preferred by Raumer. He argues for a simple illustration, that is easy to grasp and might actually help to understand the sentence. Each clause is given a different letter, with main clauses in capitals and subordinate clauses in lower-case letters. Multiple occurrences of the same letter indicate that the clause is separated into parts by another clause. The left-right ordering follows the order of the sentence, while the top-down ordering indicates the depth of the embedding. In effect, Raumer's proposal is very close the the various music-score visualisation for complex sentences, for example by Diesterweg (see [@fig:diesterweg1834_169]) or Schlecht (see [@fig:schlecht1856_79]). However, Raumer does not explicitly cite any of these earlier proposals.

### Mensing (1903) *Deutsche Grammatik für höhere Schulen* {#sec:mensing1903}

Otto Ludwig Theodor Mensing (1868-1939) was a teacher in Kiel and wrote extensively about Low German grammar. He is most well-known for his *Schleswig-Holsteinische Wörterbuch* [more biographical information is available in @molzow2000]. He also wrote various different textbooks for teaching German language and literature, among them the *Deutsche Grammatik für höhere Schulen*. His textbooks were very popular and appeared in various editions up to 1965. I have tried to access many different versions, but as Molzow [-@molzow2000: 1759] notes, textbooks are often treated as consumer goods and are not always properly archived. The many versions and editions of Mensing's textbooks needs a more detailed investigation than I am able to provide here. 

Mensing originally wrote various separate textbooks, but around 1915 they are combined into a series, called *Hilfsbuch für den deutschen Unterricht auf höheren Schulen*. As for the *Deutsche Grammatik für höhere Schulen*, there appear to be five main versions:

- The first edition of the grammar appeared in 1903. This original version contains no Satzbilder [@mensing1903], only a graphical summary of possible parts of a sentence (see [@fig:mensing1903_44]). This version becomes *Ausgabe A* around 1910 with the appearance of the special *Ausgabe B* for girl's schools. From around 1915 this grammar becomes volume 2 of the *Hilfsbuch*-series.
- Around 1913 Mensing also prepared a slimmed-down version intended for ages 11-13, called *Vorstufe zur deutsche Grammatik für höhere Schulen*. This version later becomes volume 1 of the *Hilfsbuch*-series. This *Vorstufe* originally has *Satzbilder* [@mensing1914: 77-80], but they are removed from later editions [@mensing1922].
- A separate *Ausgabe B für höhere Mädchenschulen* appeared with the 8th edition of 1910. This version is cited here from the unchanged sixth edition [@mensing1913] and does not contain *Satzbilder*.
- A revised *Ausgabe C* appeared with the 25th edition of 1925, following a revision of the Prussian teaching guidelines. This version is cited here from the 26th edition [@mensing1927].
- In 1954 a revision was prepared by Wolfgang Petersen, reprinted at least until an 8th edition of 1965, cited here from the fourth edition [@petersen1955]

::: {.im #mensing1903_44}
Schema of possible sentences structures appearing in various version of Mensing's grammar [@mensing1903: 44; @mensing1913: 54; @mensing1927: 86]. It looks like a graphical sentence analysis, but it actually shows the possible parts of a sentence, which cannot all coocurr in a single sentence. Real *Satzbilder* are added 10 years later, as shown below.
:::

Starting around 1913 Mensing adds *Satzbilder* to analyse individual sentences with a graphical display. An example from the *Vorstufe* from 1914 in shown in [@fig:mensing1914_78]. Mensing explains that the words of the sentence are part of the graph, but that they can be replaced by functional abbreviations. Only slight cosmetic changes are made in the various later revision, as shown in [@fig:mensing1927_88] from 1927 and [@fig:mensing1955_116] from 1955.

::: {.im #mensing1927_88}
*Satzbild* for the examples sentence in [@last b] from the *Ausgabe C* [@mensing1927: 88]. In this edition, this example is the only one with the full words inserted. Mensing prefers to only use the abbreviations (here in brackets) to indicate the structure of the sentence. Note that the adverb *schnell* 'quickly' is placed after the objects, although in the actual sentence it occurs between the objects.
:::

::: {.im #mensing1955_116}
*Satzbild* for the same example sentence in [@last b] from 1955 revision of Mensing's grammar [@petersen1955: 116]. This is just a cosmetic change from the 1927 version in [@fig:mensing1927_88], but interestingly the position of the adverb has been changed to coincide with the actual placement in the sentence. The abbreviations are extended with various modifiers (e.g. *d=Dativ*, *s=Genitiv*).
:::

In the 1954 revision of Mensing's grammar by Petersen there is a graphical display added for the structure of complex sentences consisting of multiple clauses [@petersen1955: 133-134]. An example is shown in [@fig:mensing1955_134]. Main clauses are indicated by a low horizontal line and subordinate clauses by high horizontal lines. Start and end of a clause are shown with the small vertical lines, and double vertical lines indicate that the clause is separated into two parts by another clause. Multiply-embedded subordinate clauses are not specifically indicated in this approach.

::: {.im #mensing1955_134}
Graphical display of the hierarchical clause structure by underlining, from Petersen's revision of Mensing's grammar [@petersen1955: 134]. Main clauses have a low underline, while subordinate clauses have a high underline. Levels of subordination are not indicated. Clauses that are separated by other clauses are marked by small double vertical lines at the point of insertion.

### Eberhard (1905) *Graphische Darstellung in der Sprachlehre* 

Johann Eberhard (born 1838) was a school director in Sigmaringen.^[Not much is available about his biography. He retired as director in 1903 and apparantly moved to Trier, see page 30 of the school report of 1904 <https://nbn-resolving.org/urn:nbn:de:hbz:061:1-882473>, accessed 10 January 2025.] After his retirement he wrote a small article about the graphical analysis of sentences [@eberhard1905], mostly as a reaction to the proposals of Stamm (see [@sec:stamm1899]). Eberhard criticises Stamm for the complexity of his analyses, which are not suitable for use in school. However, Eberhard is very positive about the idea of using graphical displays for teaching grammar.

> Das die graphische Darstellung ein erwünschtes Mittel ist, um Übersicht über ein verwickeltes Satzbilde zu erzielen, unterliegt keinem Zweifel. Nach meinen Erfahrungen bringen alle Schüler, auch die Minderbefähigten, der bezeichneten Darstellung ein großes Interesse entgegen – gewiss ein wichtiges Moment bei dem trockenen Lehrstoff! Die graphische Darstellung solcher Sätze, die in der Schule zergeliedert sind, ist deshalb auch eine viel begehrte Hausaufgabe. [@eberhard1905: 284]
>
> ('There is no doubt that graphic representation is a desirable means of gaining an overview of a complicated sentence structure. In my experience, all students, even those with less ability, show great interest in the representation shown - certainly an important aspect given the dry subject matter! The graphic representation of such sentences, which are broken down in school, is therefore also a much sought-after homework assignment.')

Eberhard's proposal for the graphical analysis of sentences is illustrated in [@fig:eberhard1905_284] for the example sentence in [@next]. Unfortunately, Eberhard still uses arbitrary numerals to indicate syntactic functions [@eberhard1905: 283], but there are not very many of those, and they are used both for phrases and for clauses.

- 1: subject *(Satzding)*
- 2: predicate *(Satzaussage)*
- 3: attribute *(Beifügung)*
- 4: argument *(Ergänzung)*
- 5: adjunct *(Umstandsbestimmung)*
  - 5a: local *(Ort)*
  - 5b: temporal *(Zeit)*
  - 5c: modal *(Weise)*
  - 5d: reason *(Grund)*

His approach is quite close to a constituent analysis, as words are hierarchically grouped by the horizontal lines. There are three large groups, which are the main clause and two subordinate clauses, although there is no graphical indication of the fact that the third clause is recursively subordinate to the second. Inside each clause the various phrases are grouped. Eberhard refrains from adding more than two hierarchical levels (e.g. *fremden* might have been analysed as a third level), but this restraint is probably didactically intended. There are a few slight inconsistencies, but those seem mostly to be a problem with the printing (e.g. *sich* should not be part of the argument in the main clause, there is a line missing below *5c* in the third clause, and the line at *Kassenanweisung* should also include the article).

::: ex
Ehrfurchtsvoll verneigte er sich vor dem fremden Herrn, der diesen Augenblick benutzte, um still eine Kassenanweisung auf den Tisch zu legen. [@eberhard1905: 284, citing Wilhelm Petsch *Der Kronprinz Friedrich Wilhelm in Karlsbad*]
:::

::: {.im #eberhard1905_284}
Graphical display of the sentence in [@last] as analysed by Eberhard [-@eberhard1905: 284]. This approach is a two-level constituency analysis, with the three clauses being subdivided into phrases. The numbers are completely arbitrary, but they are consistently used both for phrase and for subordinate clauses (roughly: 1=subject, 2=predicate, 3=attribute, 4=argument, 5=adjunct).
:::

### Nagl (1906) *Deutsche Sprachlehre für Mittelschulen*

Johann Willibald Nagl (1856-1912) mainly worked on Austrian dialects in Graz and Vienna, but towards the end of his life he also published a didactic German grammar, called *Deutsche Sprachlehre für Mittelschulen* [@nagl1906]. Some basic biographical information about Nagl is provided by Wiesinger [-@wiesinger1997].

The *Deutsche Sprachlehre* contains many graphical approaches to elucidate the grammatical structure, including many *Satzbilder* [@nagl1906: 178, 182, 186, 209-210]. Nagl uses a verb-centric tree structure for the analysis of the internal structure of the clause. Subordinate clauses can also be included in his graphical approach, as shown in [@fig:nagl1906_210] for the example in [@next].

::: ex

:::

::: {.im #nagl1906_210}
*Satzbild* for the example in [@last] from Nagl [-@nagl1906: 210].
:::

Nagl uses a different graphical approach for the analysis of the *Periode*, i.e. large complex sentences consisting of multiple clauses [@nagl1906: 210-212]. He restricts the analysis to the interrelation of the clauses, using letters in the tradition of the *Periodenbild*, as shown in [@fig:nagl1906_211] for the examples in [@next]. Capital letters are used for main clauses and lowercase letters for subordinate clauses. Internal subordinate clauses are in round brackets, and the separated parts of a single clause get the same letter with a numerical subscript. The ordering of the clauses is retained in the graphic representation. The level of embedding is additionally indicated by vertically lower placement. Dependency is additionally indicated by lines, although strictly speaking these appear to be superfluous.

### Bartmann (1907) *Sprachübungen für die Hand des Lehrers*

Josef Bartmann (1868-1947) was a teacher in Nixdorf (today Mikulášovicích in the Czech Republic).^[Some biographical information is available on Wikipedia: <https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josef_Bartmann>, accessed 6 January 2025.] He wrote various textbooks, one for teachers in 1907: *Sprachübungen für die Hand des Lehrers* [@bartmann1913, cited here in the second edition] and another one for students in 1908: *Deutsches Sprachbuch für Bürgerschulen* [@bartmann1917, cited here in the sixth edition].

For the analysis of sentences, Bartmann uses two different methods. For single-clause sentences he proposes the method of *zergliedern* 'to dissect' [@bartmann1913: 8-11], citing Kern (see [@sec:kern1883]). Like Kern, Bartmann uses line diagrams headed by the verb and he also compares these analyses to trees. The first example even has the verb at the bottom, with the verb being compared to the roots of the tree. But, also following Kern, Bartmann immediately reversed the display *der besseren Raumverteilung wegen* 'for the better use of space' [@bartmann1913: 9]. In the *Sprachbuch* he starts with a few simple line diagrams on the first page of the book [@bartmann1917: 1], only to return to it with a bit more detail towards the end [@bartmann1917: 174-176]. An example of Bartmann's diagrams is shown in [@fig:bartmann1913_11] for the example in [@next].

::: ex

:::

::: {.im #bartmann1913_11}
*Satzbild* for two coordinated simple clauses [@last] from Bartmann [-@bartmann1913: 9]. Bartmann uses verb-centric line diagrams like Kern (cf. [@fig:kern1883_17]), but the examples remain extremely simple. It remains unclear why the reflexive *sich* ist positioned as first dependent in this example.
:::

For complex sentences with multiple clauses Bartmann uses *Satzbilder* with various abbreviations for each clause [@bartmann1913: 172-176; @bartmann1917: 106-109]. An example of a complex *Gliedersatz* in the analysis of Bartmann is shown in [@fig:bartmann1913_176] for the example in [@next]. Bartmann's abbreviations are an idiosyncratic mix of the many different proposals available in the literature:

- capital letters for main clauses;
- lower-case abbreviations of functions for subordinated clauses (e.g. *erg=Ergänzung*, *beif=Beifügung*);
- superscript numbers for depth of embedding;
- numbers below for clauses, when they are separated into non-contiguous parts;
- superscript letter for various special forms (e.g. *v=verkürzt*, *m=mehrteilig*);
- optional arches to link subordinated clauses to their matrix clauses;
- multi-clause *Gliedersätze (Perioden)* are separated into a rising part (*Hebung*) and a falling part (*Senkung*), placed on top of each other with a line in between.

::: ex
[erg]{.grey} Daß der Trunkenbold sein meist mühsam erworbenes Geld in der unsinnigsten Weise verpraßt; [erg]{.grey} daß er nach und nach seine geistige und leibliche Gesundheit zerrüttet; [erg]{.grey} daß sein gesellschaftliches Ansehen mehr und mehr schwindet; [erg/2]{.grey} daß er, [beif^2^]{.grey} was das Schlimmste von allem ist, [erg/2]{.grey} seine meist völlig schuldlose Familie in Not und Verderben stürzt: [A]{.grey} das überlegt er nicht, [B]{.grey} oder es kommt ihm erst zum Bewußtsein, [zeit]{.grey} wenn es oft schon zu spät ist.
:::

::: {.im #bartmann1913_176}
*Satzbild* for a multi-clause *Gliedersatz* in [@last] from Bartmann [-@bartmann1913: 176]. Except for the different abbreviations (*erg*=complement clause, *beif*=relative clause, *zeit*=temporal adverbial clause), the sentence is divided into a rising part (*Hebung*) on top and a falling part (*Senkung*) at the bottom of the central line.
:::

### Schuberth (1908) *Deutsche Satzbilder* {#sec:schuberth1908}

Gustav Schuberth (1850-1922) was a director of a school in Großenhain. In the 33th yearbook of his school he wrote a short paper [@schuberth1908], exemplifying how *Satzbilder* can be used to analyse a text. He took the first few pages of Schiller's *Geschichte des dreißigjährigen Kriegs* and analysed all sentences with a simplified one-lined *Satzbild*. As an example of his notational system, Schiller's sentence in [@next] is analysed by Schuberth as shown in [@fig:schuberth1908_7]. I have added the abbreviations from the figure into the example below.

::: ex
[A/~2~]{.grey} In keinem andere Falle, [(v)]{.grey} als unter diesem, [A/~2~]{.grey} war es den schwächern Fürsten möglich, [(g)]{.grey} die außerordentlichen Anstrengungen von ihren Ständen zu erzwingen, [e]{.grey} wodurch sie der österreichischen Macht widerstanden; [(A)]{.grey} in keinem andern Falle den Staaten möglich, [(g)]{.grey} sich gegen einen gemeinschaftlichen Feind zu vereinigen.
:::

::: {.im #schuberth1908_7}
*Satzbild* for the example from Schiller in [@last] as analysed by Schuberth [-@schuberth1908: 7]. He uses the notation */~2~* for parts of separated clauses, round brackets for non-finite clauses, and different letters for kinds of subordinate clauses (e.g. *g=Gegenstand* for complement clauses or *e=Eigentschaft* for relative clauses). He considers the indication of the depth of embedding to be superfluous [@schuberth1908: 4].
:::

### Paul (1910) *Deutsch wie es fehlerlos geschrieben und gesprochen wird*

Theodor Paul was a *Seminar- und Präparandenlehrer*, i.e. a teacher at a teacher's seminary. I have not been able to find any further details about his biography, not even at which teacher's seminary he worked. In 1910 he wrote a German grammar, intended for self-education: *Deutsch wie es fehlerlos geschrieben und gesprochen wird* [cited here is the unchanged second edition, @paul1911a]. Two years later Paul also published an accompanying reader.^[Scans of the reader are available online at <https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Muster-Aufsätze_1912_von_Theodor_Paul>, accessed 5 June 2025.]

In the grammar, Paul uses *schematische Darstellungen durch sogenannte Satzbilder* 'schematic representations using so-called *Satzbilder*', which he first introduces only for single clauses [@paul1911a: 231]. He probably intended for the graphics to look like tree-like structures with a verbal head on top, as found widespread in Germany by this time. However, the printed version only includes horizontal and vertical lines, which make the graphics rather clumsily and difficult to understand. An example is shown in [@fig:paul1911_231] for example [@next]. The following abbreviation are used by Paul in his graphics:

- S. = *Subjekt (Satzgegenstand)* 'subject'
- P. = *Prädikat (Aussage)* 'predicate'
- O. = *Objekt (Satzergänzung)* 'object'
- U.Z. = *Umstandsbestimmung der Zeit* 'temporal adverbial'
- U.O. = *Umstandsbestimmung des Ortes* 'local adverbial'
- U.A. = *Umstandsbestimmung der Art* 'manner adverbial'
- B. = *Beifügung* 'attribute'

::: ex
[U.O.]{.grey} Am Ufer [B.]{.grey} des Ganges [P.]{.grey} verschlang [U.Z.]{.grey} heute ein [B.]{.grey} riesiger [S.]{.grey} Alligator [U.A.]{.grey} wutschnaubend einen [B.]{.grey} braunen [O.]{.grey} Inder.
:::

::: {.im #paul1911_231}
*Satzbild* of a single-clause sentence [@last] from Paul [-@paul1911a: 231]. The graphics are rather clumsily and difficult to understand, probably due to restriction of the printing process. The intended structure seem to be a verb-centric dependency tree with the predicate *verschlang* 'devoured' on top and the various dependents linked by lines pointing downwards. However, because the lines only go horizontal or vertical this structure is quite difficult to discern. On closer inspection, there are five lines departing from the central predicate on top: to the subject, the object, and to the three adverbial elements. Various of these elements additionally have an attributive *Beifügung*, which is simply placed below its head, without connnecting line.
:::

For complex clauses Paul [-@paul1911a: 268-269] adds the abbreviations *H* for *Hauptsatz* 'main clause' and *N* for *Nebensatz* 'subordinate clause'. Each clause is then individually further analysed using the single-clause model, although the examples presented in his book only contain very simple clause structures without any deep hierarchical constructions. An example of his visual approach is shown in [@fig:paul1911_268] for the example [@next]. A notewhorthy graphical detail is the addition of a thin line with feathers at each end (inserted at the right side of the graphic). This line connects the two separated parts of the German predicate, a phenomen today known as the *Satzklammer* 'sentence bracket'.

::: ex

::: {.im #paul1911_268}
*Satzbild* of a multi-clause sentence [@last b] from Paul [-@paul1911a: 268]. Each clause is internally further analysed, although the examples presented by Paul remain very simple. Also note the thin line with the 'feathers' at the ends, which indicate a discontinuous structure. In this example, it is used to show the connection between the auxiliary *bleiben* and the participle *unbedeckt*, which are regularly separated in the German main clause structure. This connection is known today as the *Satzklammer*, but it was mostly ignored by 19th Century graphical analyses.

### Erman (1913) *Stellung und Funktion der Nebensätze* {#sec:erman1913}

Konrad Bessel Erman (1888-1915) died a young man in the First World War, shortly after he finished his dissertation in Bonn [published as @erman1913a; the actual dissertation was only the first part, see @erman1913]. A short obituary is given by Schulze [-@schulze1917] and a biographical eulology is provided by his mourning father [@erman1916]. 

In his dissertation, called *Beziehungen zwischen Stellung und Funktion der Nebensätze mehrfacher Unterordnung im Althochdeutschen*, Erman investigates different kinds of subordination in Old High German texts. He uses a symbolic representation to characterise the structure of complex sentences [@erman1913a: 4-5], but refrains from calling them *Periodenbild* or *Satzbild*, although he cites various authors that use *Periodenbilder* for similar purposes [viz. @lehmann1856; @esser1878; @toifel1897; @toifel1901]. 

Erman's symbolic representation is rather different from his predecessors. An example of his display is shown in [@fig:erman1913_38] for the Old High German sentence in [@next a]. This sentence is from the 9th Century *Tatian* translation of the the Gospel of Luke. A word-by-word etymological equivalence into modern German is given in [@next b]. The Old High German translation follows the Latin structure [@next c], in which the verb *venit* of the first subordinate clause (marked *b* in the graphic) is separated by the second subordinate clause (marked *c* in the graphic). All this is placed before the main clause (marked *a* in the graphic).

Symbolic representation of the Old High German sentence from Luke 15:30 [@last] in the analysis of Erman [-@erman1913a: 38]. Erman uses his own symbolic representation, starting with *a* for the main clause, followed by subsequent letters for subordinate clauses. The arches combine parts of a clause that are separated by another clause. The "less-than" sign indicates the direction of subordination, though this is also evident from the alphabetical order.

### Pfannkuchen (1914) *Periodenbau in Goethe und Schiller* {#sec:pfannkuchen1914}

Wilhelm Pfannkuchen (born 1887) wrote a dissertation in Giessen with Otto Behagel [@pfannkuchen1914]. I have not been able to find any further reliable information about his biography.^[Pfannkuchen writes in his dissertation that he started teaching at the Ludwig-Georgs-Gymnasium in Darmstadt in 1914 [@pfannkuchen1914: 67]. The yearbook of that Gymnasium for 1915 notes that he is let go to become the director of a private school, see page 10 of <https://nbn-resolving.org/urn:nbn:de:hbz:061:1-718811>. Pfannkuchen appears to have edited some plays by Schiller in 1930. There is an entry for a Dr. phil. Wilhelm Pfannkuchen in the Addressbook of Gotha in 1949 <http://www.adressbuecher.net/addressbook/entry/54747dd11e6272f5d1ca01dc>.] Pfannkuchen's dissertation *Periodenbau in Goethes und Schillers größeren Dichtungen* is basically a long list of references to sentences in the works of Goethe and Schiller, organised by the structure of their subordination. For complex sentences, consisting of three or more clauses, he uses a graphical display to illustrate their structure [@pfannkuchen1914: 39-63]. He cites various previous authors who use a graphical display with similar goals [viz. @lehmann1852; @diringer1878; @gelbe1880; @kern1883a; @schulze1883 as discussed here previously], but in the end Pfannkuchen's graphics are a new combination of these widespread ideas. 

An example of Pfannkuchen's graphical analysis is shown in [@fig:pfannkuchen1914_60] for the *Periode* from Friedrich Schiller in [@next]. The top-down ordering indicates depth of embedding and the left-right ordering corresponds to the actual ordering of the clauses in the sentence.

### Müller (1921) *Vom Deutschunterricht in der Arbeitsschule* {#sec:müller1921}

Charlotte (Lotte) Müller (1893-1972) was a teacher and pedagogue at the university of Leipzig, propagating the didactic principles of Hugo Gaudig. After the division of Germany she became a school director in West Berlin.

Her first published work is a little booklet from 1921 *Vom Deutschunterricht in der Arbeitsschule* [@muller1922, cited here from the second edition]. The book is expanded in later editions, up to a seventh edition in 1961 with a revised title *Der Deutschunterricht. Selbsttun – Erleben – Lernen*. In this book she describes in detail how a teacher could approach the analysis of a sentence like [@next] and might end up with a graphical analysis as shown in [@fig:müller1922_49]. Rather curiously, this graphic seems to consists of two different parts, placed on top of each other. The two parts are headed by the subject noun *Die Klasse* 'the class' and predicate *spielte* 'played', respectively. However, from Müller's description it becomes clear that these two parts are supposed to be placed side-by-side and it is probably simply due to the lack of space on the printed page that they are place on top of each other. Placing them side-by-side puts this line-based graphical display in the tradition of Utzinger (see [@sec:utzinger1887]) and Mensing (see [@sec:mensing1903]).

From the accompanying text it becomes clear that the subject (*die Klasse* 'the class') and the predicate (*spielte* 'played') are supposed to be placed side-by-side. The peculiar placement on top of each other in this graphic is probably due to the limited size of the printing page. As with all line diagrams the ordering of the words in the original sentence is not transparantly reflected in this graphical analysis.

### Flothuis (1930) *Kurzgefaszte deutsche Syntax* {#sec:flothuis1930}

Marius Hendrikus Flothuis (1873-1950) was a teacher of German language and literature in Amsterdam and the father of the composer with exactly the same name.^[Registration from the Amsterdam archive: <https://archief.amsterdam/indexen/deeds/98533401-2df7-56a3-e053-b784100ade19?person=98533401-2df8-56a3-e053-b784100ade19>.] He wrote a German grammar *Einfache kurzgefaszte deutsche Syntax*, which contains many examples of graphical analyses of complex sentences called *Satzbilder* [@flothuis1930: 136-145]. Throughout his book, Flothuis is exceptionally precise in referencing the works of other scholars, but the section about the *Satzbilder* does not make any reference to previous approaches. Possibly, he considered the graphical display to be his own invention.

Flothuis' *Satzbild* for the example in [@next] is shown in [@fig:flothuis1930_136]. He uses a music-score metaphor with the main clause on top and subordinated clauses positioned downwards. The left-right order follows the actual ordering of the clauses in the sentence. The graphic includes the syntactic function of each clause, not the actual content. Parts of clauses, that are separated by another clause, are connected by a small horizontal arrow.

### Wollmann (1935) *Deutsche Sprachkunde* {#sec:wollmann1935}

Franz Wollmann (1871-1961) was director of the teacher's seminary in Krems and later in Vienna (Austria).^[Basic biographical information is available on Wikipedia at <https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franz_Wollmann>, accessed 11 February 2025. The list of publications on Wikipedia does not correspond to entries in various library catalogues that I checked.] Early in his career he wrote a small booklet *Der deutsche Sprachunterricht* [@wollmann1902] in which he cites the *Satzbilder* of Kern (see [@sec:kern1883]), Wilke (see [@sec:wilke1892]) and Trunk (see [@sec:trunk1895]), but he does not give any examples himself [@wollmann1902: 32, 55-56]. Later, he co-authored various textbooks with *Sprachübungen* 'language exercises' for teaching German. This series of textbooks was initiated by Bernhard Merth (1864-1922).^[Some basic biographical information on Bernhard Merth is available online at <https://www.biographien.ac.at/oebl/oebl_M/Merth_Bernhard_1864_1922.xml>.] There are many different editions with numerous different booklets for different grades in this series. The many editions are in need of a more detailed investigation [an early example without graphical grammar is @merth1909].

Towards the end of his active career, Wollmann wrote the *Deutsche Sprachkunde auf sprachgeschichtlicher Grundlage* [@wollmann1935], which appeared mostly unchanged in various editions at least up to a seventh edition in 1963. In this book he applies various different methods for visual syntactic analysis. First, clause-internal structure is visualised using a dependency tree as shown in [@fig:wollmann1935_15] for the examples sentence [@next a].

For complex multi-clausal sentences he uses a simplified variant of a *Periodenbild*, only using the capital letter *H=Hauptsatz* 'main clause' and the lower-case letter *n=Nebensatz* 'subordinate clause, as shown in [@fig:wollmann1935_248] for the example sentence [@next b]. Multiple subordination is indicated by lower placement. Non-finite clauses are placed inside round brackets (here *s.b.=Satzbestimmung* 'clausal modifier'). As an alternative visualisation, Wollmann also proposes to analyse multi-clause sentences using the dependency model, but now the individual nodes are complete clauses. An example of this approach is shown in [@fig:wollmann1935_250] for the example in [@next c].

### Heemstra (1947) *Grundrisz der deutsch-niederländischen Satzlehre* #{#sec:heemstra1947}

Johannes Heemstra (1882-1961) was a teacher for German in Haarlem (Netherlands).^[It is probably this person: <https://gw.geneanet.org/pveenboer?n=heemstra&oc=&p=johannes>, but the birthdate is probably wrong there, cf. <https://www.erfgoedleiden.nl/collecties/personen/zoek-op-personen/deeds/f91c6f4d-a72c-7bf0-c389-d331292bb661?person=c4f023b1-de49-408f-eb22-ed91108d4107>, both pages accessed 8 January 2025.] He studied in Leiden, defended a PhD-thesis about German participles in Groningen and later wrote various textbooks for Dutch students of German. After his retirement he wrote the *Grundrisz der deutsch-niederländischen Satzlehre* [@heemstra1947]. In this book he used a *Satzbild* as shown in [@fig:heemstra1947_76] for the example sentence in [@next]. This display is inspired by Kern (see [@sec:kern1883]), whose approach is discussed explicitly by Heemstra [@heemstra1947: 77-78]. For good measure, Heemstra also reproduces an example from Flothuis (see [@sec:flothuis1930]) as another possibility to illustrate the structure of a complex sentence [@heemstra1947: 78-79].

::: ex

### Killinger & Doppler (1950) *Deutsch: richtig gesprochen, richtig geschrieben* {#sec:killinger1950}

Robert Killinger (1925-2006, no further biographical information available) and Alfred Doppler (born 1921, professor for literature in Innsbruck, Austria),^[Some basic biographical information on Alfred Doppler is available on Wikipediat at <https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Doppler>, accessed 11 February 2025.] wrote a somewhat amusing German textbook intended to be less dry than a regular grammar. It is called *Deutsch: richtig gesprochen, richtig geschrieben* and was originally published in 1950 in Austria with the subtitle *Ein unterhaltsames Buch zur Aneigung einer fehlerfreien Sprache, zur Vervollkommung vorhandenen Wissens und zum Nachschlagen in Zweifelsfällen* 'An entertaining book to acquire error-free language, to perfect existing knowledge and for reference in cases of doubt'. It is cited here from the third edition for a German audience [@killinger1955]. In the discussion of *Satzbau* 'syntax' they use a verb-centric dependency tree, shown here in [@fig:killinger1955_131] for the example sentence in [@next]. For this graphical analysis they cite Wollmann (see [@sec:wollmann1935]).

Killinger remains active as an author of textbooks for many decades, specifically with the series *Sprachübungen*. This series was originally established by Bernhard Merth (1864-1922) and was also temporarily co-authored by Wollmann (see [@sec:wollmann1935]). There are many different editions with numerous different booklets for different grades in this series [an early example without graphical grammar is @merth1909]. I have not been able to inspect all these different versions and editions. Notably, in a version for the sixth grade, Killinger [-@killinger1975: 88] uses the music-score metaphor for the analysis of a complex multi-clause sentence [@next] as shown in [@fig:killinger1975_88]

### Langholf (1969) *Die Syntax des deutschen Amadisromans* {#sec:langholf1969}

Barbara Langholf wrote a dissertation at the university of Hamburg in 1969. She appears not to have pursued an academtic career after her dissertation as I have not been able to locate any subsequent scholarly works by her. Her dissertation investigates syntactic structures in the 16th Century anonymous German translation of the French novel *Amadis de Gaule*. The syntactic analyses used by Langholf are a direct descendant of the *Periodenbilder* of the 19th Century, although by the time of her dissertation the syntactic theories of Chomsky and Tesnière already had become widespread in the linguistic community. Langholf does not seem to have been aware of (or not interested in) those theories.

For her syntactic analyses, Langholf devised her own scheme, which she calls a *Formel* [-@langholf1969: 10]. She cites a 1955 edition of Menge's *Repetitorium* (cf. [@sec:menge1873]) as inspiration for her formulas. Menge's approach dates back to 1873, almost 100 years before Langholf's dissertation. Langholf's (and Menge's) formulas include various notational aspects that can be traced back to Lehmann's original approach from 1833 (see [@sec:lehmann1833]), including the colon for preposed clauses and brackets for internal clauses. Langholf uses forward slashes for postposed clauses, a proposal originally from Nägelsbach in 1848 (see [@sec:nägelsbach1846]). Similar to Lehmann, Langholf uses different kind of symbols for the depth of embedding:

- Main clause: capital letters *A, B, C*
- First level subordination: lower-case letters *a, b, c*: 
- Second level: accented lower-case *a', b', c'*
- Third level: digits *1, 2, 3*
- Fourth level: roman numerals *I, II, III*
- Fifth level: lower-case letters *x, y, z*
- Sixth level: accented lower-case *x', y', z'*

Langholf adds a functional category to each clause, written as a superscript abbreviation (e.g. ^rel^=relative clause, ^obj^=object clause, etc.). She also adds superscript numbers as labels to identify the clauses. This is particularly useful to link the analysis to the original sentence and to connect separated parts of the same clause, which often are positioned far apart (e.g. clause 4 in the example below). As an example of her approach, consider the example in [@next] and the corresponding analysis in [@fig:langholf1969_142]. Langholf notes that this example is extraordinary complex. Such complex constructions typically appear when the sentence is not in the French original, but added by the anonymous German translator.

## Algebraic formulae

### Götzinger (1880) *Deutsche Grammatik in genetischer Darstelllung* {#sec:götzinger1880}

Ernst Götzinger (1837-1896), son of Maximilian Götzinger (see [@sec:götzinger1836]), was a teacher in St. Gallen (Switzerland). He wrote extensively about local history, German literature and he reissued his father's books after his death [more biographical details in @dierauer1897]. He also wrote a grammar, called *Deutsche Grammatik in genetischer Darstelllung* [@gotzinger1880]. Concerning graphical display, Götzinger [-@gotzinger1880: 151] criticised the *Periodenbilder* of Lehmann (see [@sec:lehmann1833]) and proposes an alternative. Intriguingly, he does not mention his father's graphical approach, which is highly similar to the proposals by Lehmann.

Götzinger proposes a very simple model for sentence analysis, consisting only of a plus symbol and hierarchically ordered brackets [@gotzinger1880: 155-156]. He uses the term *algebraische Gleichungen* 'algebraic formulae' for his approach. Although the method is described very clearly in words, as quoted below, Götzinger does not give any examples of how his grammatical algebra works in practice for more complex sentences. A few concrete examples of Götzinger's approach are given much later by Dinkel (see [@sec:dinkel1895]).

> Will man das Satzgefüge in schematischen Bildern darstellen, so wird man sich besser der Methode der algebraischen Gleichungen bedienen. Angenommen, S heiße Subject, SS Subjectsubstantiv, P Prädicat, PV Prädicatverb, so ist die Formel jedes Satzes: S+P oder SS+PV. Beide Satzglieder lassen sich nun erweitern; ist das Subject-substantiv durch ein Adjectiv (a) oder durch eine Apposition (A) oder durch einen Genitiv (G) oder durch einen indirecten Casus (IC) erweitert, so würden die Formeln entstehen: (a+SS)+PV; (SS+A)+PV; (SS+G)+PV oder (G+SS)+PV; (SS+IC)+PV. Wäre das Prädicatsverb durch einen Accusativ (Acc.) oder Genitiv (Gen.) oder Dativ (D) oder einen indirecten Casus (IC) oder durch ein Adverb erweitert, so würde sich der Buchstabe dafür mit PV zusammenklammern lassen müssen, z.B. SS+(PV+Gen). Jede neue Erweiterung beiordnender oder unterordnender Natur ließe sich dergestalt in die Grundgleichung einfügen, ebenso jeder Nebensatz, der entweder dem Subject oder dem Prädicat angehört; das wesentlichste Mittel dieser Satztypen ist immer die Klammer, vermittelst welcher die zu einer begrifflichen Einheit zusammentretenden Einzelglieder aneinandergefügt werden. [@gotzinger1880: 156]
>
> ('When one wants to display the sentence structure in a schematic image, then it is to be preferred to use the method of algebraic equations. Suppose S is called subject, SS subjective substantive, P predicate, PV predicative verb, then the formula for each sentence is: S+P or SS+PV. Both these constituents can be expanded; when the subjective substantive is expanded with an adjective (a) or with an apposition (A) or with a genitive (G) or with an indirect case (IC), then the following formulae would arise: (a+SS)+PV; (SS+A)+PV; (SS+G)+PV or (G+SS)+PV; (SS+IC)+PV. When the predicative verb is expanded with an accusative (Acc.) or a genitive (Gen.) or dative (D) or an indirect case (IC) or with an adverb, than the letter for this expansion would be encapsulated together with the PV, e.g. SS+(PV+Gen). Likewise, each new expansion of a coordinating or subordinating nature can be inserted into the basic formula, and likewise each subordinate clause, which belong either to the subject or the predicate. The crucial method for these [more complex, MC] sentence types is the bracket, by which the elements, which are to be assembled into a conceptual unit, are joined together.')

### Dinkel (1895) *Zum Umsturz der Vulgärgrammatik* {#sec:dinkel1895}

Georg Dinkel (dates unknown) from Nürnberg wrote a small article in the *Bayerische Lehrerzeitung* about his *Plan einer einfachen Grammatik des Deutschen auf historischer Grundlage* 'plan for a simple German grammar on a historical basis' [@dinkel1895]. In this article he proposes a *Satzbild* that is based on the proposals from Ernst Götzinger (see [@sec:götzinger1880]), who is explicitly cited by Dinkel. Götzinger himself did not give any concrete examples of his approach, so the few examples in Dinkel's article are the only available examples of this kind of analysis. Of particular interest is the principle to use nested brackets to indicate hierarchical structure. For example, the sentence in [@next] is analysed with the *Satzbild* in [@fig:dinkel1895_634] 

::: ex

### Stöhr (1898) *Algebra der Grammatik* {#sec:stöhr1898}

Adolf Stöhr (1855–1921) was professor for philosophy in Vienna [biographical details in @angetter2009]. He wrote a rather curious book called *Algebra der Grammatik* [@stohr1898], which was assessed as "rather fantastic" by Jespersen [-@jespersen1937: 83]. Although idiosyncratic, Stöhr's book is not as crazy as Jespersen makes it sound. Stöhr assigns codes to linguistic elements, which are subsequently combined into larger expressions. However, his primary goal does not appear to be any detailed description of linguistics structures, but rather an attempt to try and "calculate" with these larger expressions, somewhat akin to what today would be called deriving semantic inferences. Stöhr cites the logical work of George Boole as an inspiration for his approach.

Stöhr [-@stohr1898: 6-11] differentiates between elements *a* (=*Ausdruck*, today we would say "lexical morpheme") and *d* (=*Derivation*, today we would say "grammatical morpheme"). Different morphemes are distinguished by a numeric identifier that is written above the letter. Stöhr goes into great detail for the grammatical morphemes, defining many different kinds of *d* elements. Although he explicitly states not to pursue completeness [*nicht ein erschöpfendes Verzeichnis*, @stohr1898: 15], I have counted more than 200 different defined codes in his book, classified into 15 different classes indicated by different letters.^[Just scrolling through his book, I found 46 different grammatical elements designated as *i*, 47 elements called *m*, 62 times *o*, 6 times *v*, 9 times *t*, 5 times *e*, 2 times *p*, 3 times *n*, 4 times *b*, 2 times *h*, 4 times *l*, 4 times *f*, 11 times *q*, 2 times *g* and 2 times *s*. It is beyond the scope of this book to go into more detail here.]

Elements can be combined by writing them side-by-side, called *Ableitung*, which is typically used for examples of composition and derivation (in modern terminology). This *Ableitung* is opposed to *Apposition* [@stohr1898: 51ff.] for syntactic combination, written with a star-symbol in between the elements. Stöhr notes that such *Apposition* is hierarchically organised and he proposes to use brackets to indicate this hierarchy. He exemplifies this with the example [@next] as graphically represented in [@fig:stöhr1898_87].

> Das geeignetste Zeichen für die Apposition eines selbst wiederum
durch Apposition gebildeten Ausdruckes zu anderen Ausdrücken, dürften zwei Klammern sein, zwischen welche man den zusammengesetzten Ausdruck schreibt. [@stohr1898: 87]
>

## Felderanalyse

### Drach (1937) *Grundgedanken der deutschen Satzlehre* {#sec:drach1937}

Erich Drach (1885-1935) was a professor for speech science in Berlin [some basic biographical information is available in @winkler1959]. His posthumously published book *Grundgedanken der deutschen Satzlehre* [@drach1937] is regularly cited as the foundation of the contemporary *Felderanalyse* as used widely in German syntax. However, while Drach indeed uses the term *Feld* 'field', his templatic analysis of the German clause is far from original nor innovative (see [@fig:drach1937_18]). First, the idea to name positions in relation to the verb-position in a German sentence (*Vorfeld, Nachfeld*) was already used by Lehmann in 1833 (see [@sec:lehmann1833]). Further, Drach does not distinguish between what today would be called a *Mittelfeld* and a *Nachfeld* and simply collapses everything in one position called *Nachfeld*. Additionally, Drach's analysis omits the crucial idea of a fixed position for non-finite part of the verbal complex, which today is often referred to as a *rechte Satzklammer*. This structural position was, for example, already identified by Lonkay in 1855 (see [@sec:lonkay1855]). Drach instead talks about the end of his *Nachfeld* as the *Zielpol* 'goal pole', but this is not a syntactic position in Drach's analysis. The *Zielpol* is simply the focus of the sentence, which could just as well be an object or an adverb.

::: {.im #drach1937_18}
*Grundplan* of the German sentence according to Drach [-@drach1937: 18]. Although Drach is often mentioned as the founder of the German *Felderanalyse*, his templatic structure was much simpler as the contemporary analysis. Specifically, Drach does not specify a *rechte Satzklammer* and his term *Nachfeld* corresponds roughly to what today would be called *Mittelfeld* combined with the *rechte Satzklammer*.
:::

Not widely discussed, but much more interesting, is Drach's discussion of *Umklammerung* 'bracketing'. He argues that one of the major challanges for stilistically well-build sentences in German is the syntactic tendency to insert constituents inside other constituents (rephrasing Drach's approach in contemporary terminology here). This leads to bracketing because related parts of the utterance are separated by internal subordination. Such internal subordination is used very frequently in German and can lead to *unmögliches Deutsch* 'impossible German' [@drach1937: 46]. With this slightly ironic formulation Drach does not argue that the resulting structures are syntactically ill-formed, but that they are stylistically problematic.

Drach uses different kinds of brackets to depict the levels of subordination, as illustrated in [@next] reproduced from Drach [-@drach1937: 46, similar examples on page 39 and 49]. The brackets clearly enclose parts that today would be called a constituent. The only difference to a modern constituency analysis is that Drach does not label these constituents. Other than that, Drach's *Umklammerung* is completely analogous to a constituent tree, as shown in [@fig:drach1937_46_tree]. It remains unclear what inspiration drew Drach to use hierachically ordered brackets. It does not seem to occur in any of his other writings

### Weisgerber (1950) *Vom Weltbild der deutschen Sprache* {#sec:weisgerber1950}

Johann *Leo* Weisgerber (1899-1985) was a professor for comparative linguistics in Rostock, Marburg and Bonn. An extensive discussion of his life and work is provided by Roth [-@Roth2004]. In his syntactic analyses, Weisgerber was strongly influenced by the posthumously published work of Drach (see [@sec:drach1937]). Already in *Die volkhaften Kräfte der Muttersprache* [@weisgerber1939] he cites Drach's *Grundplan* 'outline' (see [@fig:drach1937_18]) and he re-iterates the importance of Drach's notion of *Umklammerung* 'bracketing' for the syntactic stucture of German [@weisgerber1939: 54-58]. After the war, Weisgerber published his 4-volume *opus magnum*, called *Von den Kräften der deutschen Sprache*, in which he again discusses the proposals from Drach in volume 3: *Die Muttersprache im Aufbau unserer Kultur* [@weisgerber1950: *Grundplan* 120-121, *Umklammerung* 188-193]. In this discussion Weisgerber includes various different visualisation for the hierarchical structure of the *Umklammerung*. 

The first visualisation is used for the example [@next a], which Weisgerber already used in his earlier work [@weisgerber1939: 58]. However, he now adds the hierarchical visualisation as shown here in [@fig:weisgerber1950_191a]. This sentence is an example of a single hierarchical bracketing, but Weisgerber notes that it is perfectly possible, though slightly cumbersome, to have multiple such complex brackets in a single sentence. As an example he uses the sentence [@next b], visualised as [@fig:weisgerber1950_191b]. This analysis uses Drach's *Grundplan* (consisting of *Vorfeld-Mitte-Nachfeld*), but in a rather different way from all other examples from both Drach and Weisgerber. Normally only the verb *fand* 'found' would be placed in the middle, the rest would be placed in the *Nachfeld*. Also note that the predicative bracket *fand…statt* from the verb *stattfinden* 'to take place' is not considered as a bracket. This kind of "particle-verb" bracket is very common in German, and Weisgerber includes such structures as a bracket in the other examples shown here [@next a,c]. For the more complex example in [@next b] he is clearly stimified by Drach's simplistic *Grundplan*, which does not include a separate position for the verb particle. Such a position is commonly added in contemporary analyses of German (e.g. as a *rechte Satzklammer*). Finally, Weisgerber presents yet another example of a single hierarchically complex bracketing in [@next c] with a visually pleasing diagram as shown in [@fig:weisgerber1950_193]. In this illustration he tries to emphasize the ordering and the hierarchichal depth of the bracketing.

In the second, much expanded, edition of this work, Weisgerber repeats the same illustrations [@weisgerber1954: 190-192]. Furthermore, he adds another approach for the visualisation of hierarchical structure by using a "chinese boxes" diagram with hierarchically enclosed rectangles [@weisgerber1954: 252]. However, this illustration is copied verbatim from the work of his student Gipper (see [@sec:gipper1950]) and will be discussed there.

Curiously, Weisgerber ignores the verb+particle bracket *fand…statt*. Similar structures are implicitly analysed as a bracket in the other visualisations of Weisgerber. In this example, Weisgerber is probably confused by the simplistic *Grundplan* from Drach (see [@fig:drach1937_18]) which does not include a position for the sentence-final particle ("*rechte Satzklammer*").

:::

### Gipper (1950) *Sprachliche und geistige Metamorphosen* {#sec:gipper1950}

Helmut Gipper (1919-2005) was a professor for general linguistics in Münster and a student of Weisgerber (see [@sec:weisgerber1950]).^[The best biographical summary for Gipper that I could find is on the German Wikipedia at <https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helmut_Gipper>.] He finished his dissertation *Sprachliche und geistige Metamorphosen bei Gedicht-Übersetzungen* in 1950, but it was only published in 1966 in *einen fast unveränderten Druck* 'an almost unchanged edition' [@gipper1966: 8]. In the preparation of his dissertation, Gipper had access to a pre-print version of Weisgerber's [-@weisgerber1950] *Von den Kräften der deutschen Sprache* and he cites Weisgerber's example [@last a] as an example of hierarchical embedding. 

Gipper develops his own visualisation using a "Chinese boxes" approach to show the hierarchical structure *in einer besonders anschaulichen Form* 'in a particularly vivid manner' [@gipper1966: 118]. As shown in [@fig:gipper1966_119], he compares the central embedding of German with the right-modifying structure of the French translation. This visualisation is quoted verbatim by Weisgerber in the second edition of *Von den Kräften der deutschen Sprache* [@weisgerber1954: 252]. Gipper does not cite Pike (see [@sec:pike1943]), Diderichsen (see [@sec:diderichsen1947]) or Mikuš (see [@sec:mikuš1947]), who also use this visualisation in the same period in which Gipper wrote his dissertation. Apparently, this visual idea became *en vogue* in the 1940s.

During the 1940s various other, apparently independent, example of this visualisations are found in the linguistic literatur.

### Glinz (1952) *Die innere Form des Deutschen* {#sec:glinz1952}

Hanz Glinz (1913-2008) was professor for German philology in Aachen. A biographical summary and an in-depth discussion of his work is provided by Zlobinska-Görtz [-@zlobinska-gortz2018]. His *Habilitationsschrift* was accepted in Zürich in 1948 and published as *Die innere Form des Deutschen. Eine neue deutsche Grammatik* [@glinz1952]. This book was widely discussed in Germany and is generally considered to be an early example of a structuralist grammar for German. Glinz consistently uses *Proben*, i.e. syntactic constituency tests, to analyse the grammatical structure of German.

Glinz' book contains two large examples in which he uses a literary text to illustrate graphically how his analysis works in practice. The first example uses a paragraph from Goethe's *Wilhelm Meisters theatralische Sendung* and a paragraph from Heinrich Keller's *Der grüne Heinrich* [@glinz1952: 71-72]. The full analysis takes up ten whole pages [@glinz1952: 316-325]. The last sentence from this exemplary analysis [@next] is reproduced here in [@fig:glinz1952_325]. This visualisation places the words from top to bottom with thick black indicators for the verbal elements of the sentence. Glinz very clearly includes both the "finite" second position (*Leitglied*) and the sentence-final "infinite" position (*Nennglied*) in his analysis of the German sentence. The arrows indicate the governer of the case assignment. In the complex noun phrases the horizontal lines indicate the hierarchical structure. Subordinate clauses (not shown in the figure here) are not visually distinguished in this large example.

:::

Glinz' second large example is introduced as a massive 10-page fold-out sheet inserted between pages 472 and 473. For this exemplary analysis Glinz uses a paragraph from a letter from Goethe, sent on the 12th of november 1779 and published in the collection *Briefen aus der Schweiz*. The graphical analysis of the first sentence of this letter [@next b] is shown here in [@fig:glinz1952_472]. The linked high-resolution image shows a panorama of the complete fold-out sheet. In this visualisation the words are ordered horizontally and there are lines added on top of the whole example. These lines indicates the depth of clausal embedding: deeper embedding is indicated by lines that are higher positioned.

## More recent didactic approaches

### Rahn & Pfleiderer (1951) *Deutsche Spracherziehung*

Fritz Rahn (1891–1964) and Wolfgang Pfleiderer (1877-1971) were teachers in the region around Stuttgart, Germany.^[some basic biographical information is available on Wikipedia at <https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fritz_Rahn> and <https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfgang_Pfleiderer_(Philologe)>, accessed 9 January 2026.] They wrote an extensive educational framework for teaching German called *Deutsche Spracherziehung* in various editions throughout the 1950s. These books are written as collections of methods and exercises for teachers to be used in class.

In the *Ergänzungsheft* 'amendment book' they propose a very simply graphical scheme for the analysis of sentences, based on squares for main clauses and circles for subordinate clauses, as shown in [@fig:rahn1951_46] [@rahn1951: 46].

::: {.im #rahn1951_46}
Explanation for the *Satzbild* from Rahn & Pfleiderer [@rahn1951: 46]. Enclosed graphics are only used when the superordinate clause is sequentially split into two parts by the subordinate clause.
:::

They allow for hierarchical embedding, but only for clauses that are surrounded by parts of their superordinate clause. Multiple embedding that are placed sequentially is not specifically indicated in their graphical approach. This results in rather unsatisfactory analyses of more complex sentences. As a more involved example, they present sentence [@next], which sounds like a litarary quotation, but there is no indication from which literary source it stems. This sentence is analysed graphically as shown in [@fig:rahn1953_148]. There are multiple cases of subordinate clauses embedded inside other subordinate clauses, but this is not expressed in this simple scheme. The only hierarchical structure indicated (by the circle inside the square) is in the situation in which the subordinate clause is positioned such that the superordinate clause is split into two parts.

This small booklet hat an appendix about the *Leitzätze udn Lehrziele zum neuen Grammatik-Unterricht* [@rahn1951a: 20-24], written together with Pfleiderer. Here they propose to use different kinds of underlining for different parts of the sentence, and also to use different colours on the blackboard (see [@fig:rahn1951_20]):

- subject: single line in red
- verb: think single line in green
- object and nominal predicate: double line in blue
- adjuncts: dotted line in brown

### Griesbach & Schulz (1960) *Grammatik der deutschen Sprache*

Dora Schulz (1906-1974) in 1951 was a founding members of the *Goethe-Insitut*, a German nonprofit organisation that promotes knowledge and study of the German language internationally. Heinz Griesbach (1918-2008) joined the institute in 1953 as a teacher and later became the head of the institute's first teaching centre in Bad Reichenhall until his retirement in 1970. Because they were not satisfied with available German teaching materials for non-native speakers, Schulz and Griesbach developed their own textbooks on the basis of their practical experience, including a *Grammatik der deutschen Sprache* [@griesbach1960]. A first-hand personal account of the early years of didactic work at the Goethe-Institut in the 1950s is provided by Griesbach [-@griesbach2001].

Griesbach & Schulz [-@griesbach1960: v] cite Glinz (see [@sec:glinz1952]) and Erben (see [@sec:erben1958]) as influences, but their approach to syntax in the *Grammatik der deutschen Sprache* is quite innovative and much clearer in presentation than that of their predecessors. They define a *Satzfeld* (today referred to as *Mittelfeld*), delimited by a *Satzrahmen* (today referred to as *Verbalklammer*), i.e. the two possible positions for parts of the predicate. In front of the *Satzfeld* there is a *Vorfeld* and after it there is a *Nachfeld* [@griesbach1960: 294-301]. The *Satzrahmen* is graphically displayed by two black quarter circles, as shown in [@fig:griesbach1960_295]. Although this templatic approach to the structure of the German sentence has a long history, this is the first clear and simple statement of what today is known as the *topologische Feldermodell* for the German sentence.

::: {.im #griesbach1960_295}

In front of the *Satzrahmen* there is a position called *Vorfeld* and after it there is a *Nachfeld*. This is the first succinct visual presentation of a templatic sentence model for the German language, which is still used today, known as the *Feldermodell*. The only difference is that the *Satzfeld* is nowadays called *Mittelfeld*.
:::

Griesbach & Schulz [-@griesbach1960: 370-371] take this approach even further and apply it to the analysis of multiple-embedded sentence constructions, as shown in [@fig:griesbach1960_371] for the example sentence [@next]. They call such an illustration a *Satzbild*, which indicates that they were aware of this tradition of syntactic analysis. In their *Satzbild*, each clause is depicted with a *Satzrahmen* consisting of two black quarter circles and all sentence consitituents are squares (for arguments) or triangles (for adjuncts). Different from all *Satzbilder* in the German tradition, subordinate clauses are here positioned vertically above the main clause. Each subordinate clause has itself a function in its matrix clause.

- Squares are used to indicate verbal arguments, with a letter indicating the case: *N=Nominativ, A=Akkusativ, D=Dativ*.
- Triangles are used for adjuncts, with the letters *T* being used for temporal and *M* for modal adjuncts.
- Subjunctions and complementizers are indicated by white arrows in the leftmost black quarter-circle. Conjunctions are marked as plus-symbols (not shown here). They do not include any example of relative clauses in their graphical examples.

In a later revision of the grammar [@griesbach1970: 417], the geometric objects are removed and subordination is depicted downwards, as shown in [@fig:griesbach1970_417]. This graphical approach is more in line with the new Chomskyan "style" of syntactic trees, which is explicitly acknowledged in the introduction [@griesbach1970: xiv].

This "style" of syntactic analysis is more in-line with the Chomskyan approach, which has become fashionable at this point in time.
