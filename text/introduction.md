# Visualising sentences

## Before Chomsky and Tesnière

At least since the late 1950s, with the publication of Chomsky [-@chomsky1957] and Tesnière [-@tesniere1959], the idea to draw graphical representations of sentence structure has become a cornerstone of contemporary linguistics. However, graphical procedures for the syntactic analysis of language have a long history, far predating Chomsky and Tesnière. Both these men have been quite tight-lipped about the sources of inspiration for their syntactic displays, implicitly suggesting that their graphical conceptualisations of sentence structure were singular innovations. Quite to the contrary, in this book I will attempt to show that there is a continuous tradition of graphical grammar going back to about 1830, with even a few incidental precursors predating that starting point. This history, about 200 years at the time of this writing, has many twist and turns, with forgotten, rediscovered and independently discovered ideas, with periods of frantic innovation followed by phases of settling tradition, and in general with the promise of graphical grammar lingering in the scientific air.

A central driver of innovation for visual methods throughout this history was education. Time and again, the didactic desire to clarify the often twisted linguistic constructions used by our most beloved geniuses of language, by our great authors and poets, drove teachers to the drawing board. Quite literary, it might very well have been the general availability of blackboards in schools that kicked of the graphing craze starting in 1830s. Lyman describes for the USA that "as late as 1835 the idea of using slates and blackboards was exceedingly novel; in only a few schools does it appear to have been attempted before this time" [@lyman1922: 148]. He even quotes a contemporary educator from the 1830s:

> In the study of grammar the blackboard may be used to exhibit the inflections of the various parts of speech; it may also be used in syntax, to point out the connection of the principal words to each other. The method of doing this is by writing on the board the sentence to be parsed, **and then connecting by curved lines those words that have any grammatical connection with each other**. The instructor at the same time pointing out what that relation is. [James Ray 1830, cited in @lyman1922: 148, emphasis added]

Yet, also from the very start the graphical methods were also used to clarify linguistic structures in scholarly debates.

## Graphical methods

- symbols inserted between words
- symbols added/above each word
- symbolic abbreviations
- curly braces for grouping
- other brackets for grouping
- vertical/slanted lines
- chinese boxes
- numbered tables
- positional tables/templates
- music score, high/low lines
- indentation
- etc.

## Structure of this book

The current structure of this manuscript has all historical developments organised roughly by nationality. At this stage, this is just an practical strategy to classify the material. The ultimate structure of the book might very well be organised by scholarly traditions. However, the basic units of the story will always be the third-level sections that summarise the contribution of a specific author. The general plan is to compile for each author a little miniature of a few pages with a few selected images illustrating their graphical approach. Only in very few cases I have decided to discuss the same author in multiple sections.

There are often multiple editions of the works that are discussed here, and these different editions sometimes contain quite different ideas. So it is important to check exactly which edition is consulted. The bibliography includes links to scans of the originals, with different entries for the different editions consulted. Unfortunately, not all crucial editions are available online yet. For now, low-quality scans of crucial pages from books that I have been able to inspect in person are linked via a personal repository.

As a result, every cited reference in the text is clickable and leads directly to the bibliographical entry, which contains a link to the original online. This will be exactly the edition that is cited in this book, so the cited page numbers will match. You will still have to manually scroll to the respective page numbers, but in this way the original context of every contribution discussed here is easily available for closer inspection to the interested reader.

# General issues

## The rise of the subject-object-predicate trinity

Slowly, during the 17th and 18th Century, a new terminological amalgamation arose, combining terms from Aristotelian logic with concepts from the descriptive grammatical tradition. The result of this mixture are the contemporary terms "subject", "object" and "predicate", which seem to be first used in the modern sense at the start of the 19th Century. The history of the emergence of these terms deserves a detailed investigation in it's own right [cf. @forsgren1985; -@forsgren1992 for the German grammatical tradition]. The following summary is but a very short and strongly simplified overview of this terminological development. The underlying impetus for this development appears to be an ambition on behalve of grammarians to insert more "logic" into their analyses, or, in more modern terms, to create general terms for ~~grammatical functions~~ on top of the description of the ~~grammatical form~~ of linguistic elements.

Everything starts with Aristoteles. First, the term "subject", through Latin *subiectum*, is a calque from Greek *ὑποκείμενον* 'that which lies beneath'. This term is one of the central tenets of Aristotelian philosophy of substance. Similarly, the term "predicate" is derived from Latin *praedicatum*, which is a calque from Greek *κατηγορούμενον* 'that which is being spoken against'. These two elements, subject and predicate, are the building blocks of the Aristotelian (and medieval) logical proposition, not of a linguistic sentence. In contrast, linguistically a Greek *λόγος* 'sentence' consists of *ὄνομᾰ* 'noun' and *ῥῆμα* 'verb'. Although Aristotle describes a third element linking the logical terms *ὑποκείμενον* 'subject' and *κατηγορούμενον* 'predicate', he does not use a specific term for this third element. Moro [-@moro2017: 35] argues that only with Abelard in the 12th Century a specific term is introduced for this link, namely the Latin term *copula*. Separataly, the term object, from Latin *objectum*, is a calque from Aristotle's *ἀντικείμενον* 'that which lies opposite'. This term does not play any role in classical logical analysis, nor in linguistic analyses. It only figures as a philosophical concept for observed reality.

In the ensuing centuries, the Latin terms *subiectum*, *praedicatum* and *copula* become a staple in medieval logic, specifically in the analysis of the syllogism. In contrast, these terms are never used for grammatical analysis of language. For example, the 13th Century scholastic grammarians (the "Modists") use *suppositum* and *appositum* approximately in the sense of the Greek *ὄνομᾰ* and *ῥῆμα*, respectively [@robins1980a: 234].

In the 17th Century, the *Grammaire Générale et Raisonnée* from 1660 by Antoine Arnauld and Claude Lancelot is probably one of the first occurences of new terminology. In their attempt to link language to logic and thought, there is a first glimpse of a terminological confluence of Aristotelian logic and the grammatical tradition, as the french word *sujet* ist used, although alongside *attribut* and not yet something like *prédicat*:

> La connoissance de la nature du Verbe dépend de ce que nous avons dit au commencement de ce discours, que le jugement que nous faisons des choses (comme quand je dis, *la terre est ronde*) enferme necessairement deux termes; l’un appellé sujet, qui est ce dont on affirme, comme, *terre*; & l’autre appellé attribut, qui est ce qu’on affirme, comme *ronde*: Et de plus la liaison entre ces deux termes, qui est proprement l’action de notre esprit qui affirme l’attribut du sujet. [@arnauld1660: 89]
> 
> ['The knowledge of the nature of the Verb depends on what we said at the beginning of this discourse, that the judgment we make about things (as when I say, *the earth is round*) necessarily includes two terms: one called subject, which is what we affirm about, such as *earth*; and the other called attribute, which is what is affirmed, such as *round*. And moreover the connection between these two terms, which is strictly the action of our mind that affirms the attribute about the subject.' translation from @kahane2020: 100]

Also in the 17th Century, Christopher Cooper in his *Grammatica Linguae Aglicanae*, a grammar of the English language written in Latin, makes an attempt to bridge the two worlds of grammatical and logical analysis, clearly articulating the difference between the grammatical term "nominative" and the logical term "subject". He also uses the term "predicate", but apparently not yet "object":

> Substantivum … Et hoc a *grammaticis* noncupatur casus nominativus, a *logicis* subjectum. … Id … vocatur praedicatum; quod si duobus verbis exprimitur, substantivum vel adjectivum subsequens copulam in regimine. [@cooper1685: 171-172]
> 
> ('Noun, … grammatically it is called nominative, logically it is called subject. … It is called predicate when there are two words expressed, noun or adjective following a copula.')

In the 18th Century the use of the logical terminology for functional categories in the analysis of sentence structure broadens. For example, in France, l'Abbé Girard in *Les vrais principes de la language françoise* [-@girard1747: 90-92] uses the terms *Subjectif*, *Attributif* and *Objectif* [see also @forsgren1985: 43]. He seems to build on the *sujet/attribut* terminology from the *Grammaire Générale et Raisonnée* (see above) and extends this functional approach to other aspects of linguistic structure, notebly introducing the term "object". In Germany, Johann Christoph Adelung in his *Umständliches Lehrgebäude der Deutschen Sprache* [-@adelung1782: 61] uses the terms *Subject* and *Praedicat*, but not anyting resembling the term object. In yet another example, this time from England, Joseph Priestly in his *Rudiments of English Grammar* (1772) uses the terms "subject" and "object", but he does not appear to have used the term "predicate":

> *Q.* What is meant by the Subject of an affirmation? \
> *A.* The person of thing concerning which the affirmation is made.
> 
> *Q.* What is a verb transitive? \
> *A.* A verb transitive, besides having a subject, implies, likewise, an object of the affirmation, upon which its meaning may, as it were, pass; and without which the sense would not be complete. [@priestley1772: 13]

In the 19th Century the use of the terms subject, object and predicate becomes standard practice. For example, Heyse [-@heyse1827: 633-634], a highly influential German grammar from the start of the century, uses the terms *Subject/Gegenstand*, *Prädicat/Äußerung* and *Object/Zielwort*. However, even he feels the urge to explicitly introduce the latinate terms as "foreign". For example, when introducing *Gegenstand* and *Äußerung* as the basic parts of a sentence, he says: *sie werden als solche mit einem fremden Namen das ~~Subject~~ und ~~Prädicat~~ genannt.* 'with a foreign name, they, as such, are called subject and predicate' [@heyse1827: 633]. The grammar of Murray was similarly highy influential in the English speaking world, with numerous editions appearing throughout the 19th Century. However, he uses the terms "subject" and "object", but never "predicate", opting for "attribute" instead: "the principal parts of a simple sentence are, the subject, the attribute, and the object" [@murray1824: 126].

These are just a few examples of the gradual adoption of erstwhile logical terminology into the realm of grammatical description. The expansion of this terminology in the 17th and 18th Century needs a more detailed investigation than what I am able to provide here. But by the start of the 19th Century the terms *subject*, *object*, *predicate* and *copula* all seem to have been accepted as regular terms for grammatical analysis. Yet, there are two aspects of the logical origin of these terms that spill over into the grammatical realm and remain widespread in the 19th Century and beyond. These are, first, the balanced and privilaged bond between subject and predicate [cf. the "S-P-Funktion" in @forsgren1992: 75-76] and, second, the universality of the copula [cf. the "Copula-Theorie" in @forsgren1992: 135-153].

There seem to be at least two reasons:

- First, the opposition subject/predicate with many authors becomes just a updated terminological replacement for the classical linguistic concepts of Greek *ὄνομᾰ*/*ῥῆμα* or Latin *suppositum/appositum*.
- Second, IE verb inflection
- Argument against: developing ideas about the verb as centre of the sentence, projecting roles/arguments.
- argument against the copula-theory, e.g. Wundt 1880.
