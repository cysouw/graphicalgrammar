## Teaching grammar to the Deaf

### Sicard (1799) *Cours d'instruction d'un sourd-muet*

grammaire generale [@sicard1798a] numbers p. 29 "chiffre", but only one example?

Cours d'instruction [@sicard1799] numbers? p 64-71, 101, 112, 178, 332-333. graphics: 89

### Barnard (1836) *Analytic Grammar*

> The method of illustrating the principles of syntax employed in the following treatise, is one which has been, for a number of years, advantageously used in the instruction of the deaf and dumb. […] The first notions of the writer regarding it, were obtained while he was engaged as an instructor in the American Asylum, at Hartford, in the years 1831 and 1832. The *method*, which it at present exhibits, has been, however, the result of a more recent labor, during the writer's residence, in a corresponding capacitiy, at the New York Institution for the Instruction of the Deaf and Dumb. [@barnard1836: iii]

Analytic Grammar; With Symbolic Illustration. New York: E. French. https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/008991837 No trees, but “symbolic sentences” in which categories are marked. Some ideas of levels http://www.polysyllabic.com/?q=node/336. Developed at school for the deaf in Hartford! based on l’epee/sicard “. This development seems to be linked to deaf-education, see [@wing1887: 86]

### March (1869) *A parser and analyzer for beginners*

Francis A. March, A Parser and Analyzer for Beginners, with Diagrams and Suggestive Pictures (1869). http://www.polysyllabic.com/?q=olddiagrams/clarkderiv
thanks to: Richard Salter Storrs (deaf education in hartford, mentioned in preface of March 1869), see [@williams1885: 102]

### Storrs (1880) *Methods of deaf-mute teaching*

[@storrs1880; @storrs1880a; @storrs1881]

### Wing (1885) *Function symbols*

[@wing1885] further development of storrs/peet symbols for the deaf (which were also the basis for March 1869)


## Syntactic tables

### Becker (1830) *A grammar of the German language* {#sec:becker1830}

Note tables in [@becker1830: 253-261]

### James (1847) *The elements of grammar*

"construction" in table-like manner like Becker 1830 [@james1847: 133-134]

### Morell (1852) *The analysis of sentences*

Morell [@morell1857; @morell1852] is based on Becker 1829! But simplifies into tables, and removes ordering. Tables become widespread in GB

table p24-25, complex sentence p41

### Swinton (1872) *A progressive grammar of the English tongue*

William Swinton (1833-1892) in USA (Professor of the English language in the University of California??? Preface written in New York), but no diagram - more likely britisch tradition

tabular based on Becker [@swinton1872: 154]

Swinton (1872: iii-iv) “The introduction, some thirty years ago, of the method of Sentential Analysis, devised by the German philologist Becker, and adapted to American school use in the meritorious works of Professor Greene and others, marks the only considerable innovation, in this country, on the Murray system.”

He writes many versions of grammars and textbooks, but never uses diagramming. He cites many GB-grammars (p. viii), so this work seems to belong more in that tradition

### Morris (1877) *English grammar*

Also USA, but only using tables [@morris1877: 100-111]

### Mason (1881) *English grammar*

first edition [@mason1858] no tables
25th edition [@mason1881: 183-185] with tables (fold-out appendix after p268)

### Fitch (1881) *Lectures on teaching*

long-form analysis like becker [@fitch1881: 268-269]

### Meiklejohn (1882) *The standard grammar*

graphical display "mapping" [@meiklejohn1882: 20, 22, 147, 168-169]

"mapping out" = diagramming? [@meiklejohn1886: 92, 97-98]
"continuous analysis = Becker-style? [@meiklejohn1886: 99]
tables p.98

### Cooper & Sonnenschein (1891) *An English grammar for schools*

table [@cooper1891: 9]
indentation [@cooper1891: 25]

### Davidson & Alcock (1889)

https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/006151225
table analysis p212, large example p220

many different books and version, first collaboration from 1873

### Nesfield (1898) *English grammar, past and present*

tables [@nesfield1898: 105-117]

### Onions (1904) *Advanced English syntax*

Charles Talbut Onions (1873-1965) Many editions, at least untill 1932

tables and indented complex sentences [@onions1904] *sentence picture* p.25

## Proto-Diagramming

### Wilbur (1814) *The grammatical alphabet*

[@wilbur1814] pictures for word classes. the "chart" mentioned could be this one: https://lccn.loc.gov/2020768232 (not digital)

[@wilbur1821] *The grammatical key* same picture for word classes, but apparently not used to draw pictures of sentences. In sentence analysis the numbers are used for parsing word classes. symbols and numbers are changed from the 1814 version

word "chart" replaced by "atlas" in furthermore exactly the same sentences.

### Brown (1831) *The American grammar*

- construing p.22: major/minor sections with different brackets p.29
- scanning (p35-40)
- scheme (p81-88), parsing

"Construing consists in dividing a sentence into sections or groups, ascertaining their true constructive relation, learning their exact significant characters, and referring the inferior sections to their respective superiors." (p. xii)

### Andrew & Stoddard (1836) *A grammar of the Latin language*

no graphics, but very concise description of dependency structure

> In analyzing a proposition, it is first to be divided into its logical subject and predicate. \
> If the logical subject consists of more than one word, its grammatical subject should be pointed out, and distinguished as simple or compound. \
> When the grammatical subject is determined, the words which modify or limit it should next be specified, and then the words which modify them, and so on, until the logical subject is exhausted. \
> In analyzing the logical predicate, the grammatical predicate should first be mentioned, then the words which modify or limit it, and their modifiers, until the logical predicate is exhausted. [@andrews1836: 254-255

::: ex
Mithridātes, duārum et viginti gentium rex, totǐdem linguis jura dixit
:::

> The logical subject is *Mithridātes duārum et viginti gentium rex*. \
> The logical predicate is *totǐdem linguis jura dixit*. \
> The grammatical subject is *Mithridātes*: this is modified by rex. Rex
is limited by *gentium*, which is itself limited by *duārum* and *viginti*.
*Et* connects *duārum* and *viginti*. \
> The grammatical predicate is *dixit*, which is limited by *jura* and *linguis*, and the latter by *totǐdem*. [@andrews1836: 255-256]

### Barrett (1837) *The principles of language*

parsing inspired by Brown???

[@barrett1837] system of parsing (introduced to the learner in the preface vii-viii), key to analysis p. 29, parsing explained p31. Text of later image on p. 33.

"scanning" on page 113.

slightly different title, but probably just a new edition[@barrett1845] insert between p.18 and 19. Parsing of the examples by letters, p.18-31

[@barrett1857], same graphic plate beween p18 and p19. Parsing exemplified p66-75

new plates: at start, before p85 in latin

note morpheme-separation by dashes in Latin p.125-131

new book [@barrett1859] proposing 21 different relations (p.28), the numbers are written to each word when parsing a sentence

### Peirce (1839) *The grammar of the English language*

"chains" on p. 50, 52, 140 [@peirce1839]

"as the dependence of words in a sentence is more fully illustrated by the following figurative exemplifications, the pupil should study them till he shall be able, without difficulty, to apply to them any simple sentences that he shall find." [@peirce1839: 47]

"immediate dependence" vs. "intermediate connection" (p. 141)

numbered example sentences p. 233-241, there appears to be some implicit hierarchical ordering, but no clear explanation. Maybe numbering like Brown?

### Greene (1846) *A treatise on the structure of the English language*

Samuel Stillman Greene (1810-1883)

cited here in printing from 1849. graphics "formula for a sentence" [@greene1849: 70, 82, 111, 120, 167, 184] meaning of digits is unclear

Later different systems, e.g.

- [@greene1860: 171-177] subject-predicate base with modifiers in brackets
- [@greene1874: 23-24] summarise structure with "significant symbols" S, P, a, o, v (cf Jespersen??? just coincidence...)

### Hall (1849) *Encyclopedia of English grammar*

"Monology" inspired by Brown! Numbering to indicate constituents ("monos") [@hall1850: 197-305]. Also bracketing with square and round brackets.

identical in 1849 version. bad scan at https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofen00hall/page/296/mode/2up?q=monology

Not the same person as William D. Hall from 1898 diagrams.

coincidence "monème" by Henri Frei *La grammaire des fautes* (1929) ???

## Diagramming

### Clark (1847) *The Science of the English Language*

Stephen W. Clark (1810-1901) was a school principal of East Bloomfield Academy and wrote the influential book *The science of the English language. A practical grammar: in which words, phrases, and sentences are classified according to their offices, and their various relations to one another. Illustrated by a complete system of diagrams.* [@clark1847] He produced revisions of this book and wrote variants for different readers up to the 1870s [e.g @clark1870, see [@mazziotta2016: 303-305 for the little that is known about Clark]. A detailed investigation of the work of Clark is available in Mazziotta [-@mazziotta2016; -@mazziotta2020a; -@mazziotta2020].

It remains unclear whether Clark has had any sources of inspiration for his graphical display. In the preface he writes that he has been testing his method at least since 1840. The "chains" of Pierce (1839)

> for the convenience of teachers a manuscript grammar was prepared, which embodied the principles of the science and the Author's mode of presenting it. These principles and this method have been properly tested by numerous and advanced classes during the seven years last past. [@clark1847: iii]

Term *office* ~ syntactic function?

He uses the term *diagram*

adjuncts are hanging, but also enclosed as boxes on p17!

[@clark1847] very interesting frontispiece in the first edition! Is later sold separately as a poster for schools

### Holbrook (1859) *The normal, or method of teaching*

graphical analysis [@holbrook1859: 174], citing "Brown's rules of syntax" [@holbrook1859: 165], probably Goold Brown. He also cites "Clark's grammar, revised edition"

complete grammar in 1873, same diagrams [@holbrook1873: 145-151]

nicer scan here (later version, same examples): https://archive.org/details/newenglishgramma00holb/page/224/

### Chandler (1861) *A class book on English grammar and analysis*

1860 [@chandler1860] version has no diagrams, added in revised edition 1861 [@chandler1861]

"models for black board exercises" (p151-160) very clear inspiration for later Reed/Kellog (Reed/Kellog say in introduction that their system arose in 1868, so clearly later than chandler)

### York (1862) *An Analytical, Illustrative, and Constructive Grammar*

Richard Brantley York (1805-1891) Brantley York was an educator, author, and Methodist clergyman in North Carolina. He organized Union Institute Academy at Brown's Schoolhouse in Randolph Co., N.C. in 1839, which would evolve into Normal College, Trinity College, and later Duke University.

Kern is cited (p558) graphical display is presented as "normal" in Germany, example [@dale1897: 557]

### Adamson (1907) *The practice of instruction*

"schema" = diagramming? [@adamson1907: 176-177]

## Immediate constituents

### Wundt (1880) *Logik* {#sec:wundt1880}

Hypothesis that Wundt influenced Bloomfield: [@percival1976: 234-235 gives various detailed arguments]

not much effect in German linguistics, but see Delbrück 136ff https://books.google.de/books?id=BAQLAAAAMAAJ (no graphics though) https://doi.org/10.1515/9783111457642

Debate about logical analysis: Wundt proposes recursive subject-predicate pairing as a model for though and language: note that this is the logical tradition of the terminology, not the grammatical!

Wundt's discussion of the 'old grammarians' [@wundt1900b: 222-224], arguing against the 'copula-theory'

See [@picardi2022: 24-26] for the relation with Frege

See [@dittrich1902] for a direct following of Wundt in Germany, otherwise nothing found

### Sheffield (1912) *Grammar and thinking* {#sec:sheffield1912}

Alfred Dwight Sheffield [@sheffield1912: 50-51] Grammar and Thinking (citing Wundt prominently) Brittain (1973:204) says “linguists seem to have been unaware of his work”. This is not true!

also Alfred Dwight Sheffield [@sheffield1929: 53]

- Nida cites him in 1943 dissertation
- Jespersen cites him in 1913 Sprogets Logic
- review by Bloomfield, quite critical [@bloomfield1912]

### Sapir (1921) *Language* {#sec:sapir1921}

morphology-formula [@sapir1921]

### Bloomfield (1933) *Language*

[@bloomfield1933: 161]

[@bloomfield1914: 60-61], cited in Percival (1976:235) clearly thinks about binary branching. Also note the Wundt-inspired psychological reasoning.

### Mikuš (1947) *Le Syntagme EST-IL Binaire?*

Francis Mikuš from Ljubljana, cf [@graffi2001: 201]

trees following Wundt [@mikus1947: 37], includes "chines boxes" diagram, without attribution.

boxes: [@1952: 452, 457, 460], numbers [@1952: 453, 458], spiral [@1952: 461], boxes with connections [@1952: 462]

reanalysis of Sapirs symbolic representation, boxes on page 20 [@mikus1953: 20]

### Nida (1949) *Morphology*

nothing in 1946 version! [@nida1946]

sentence: [@nida1949: 87]
hierarchical morphological structure p.101, both 105

### Harris (1951) *Methods in structuralist linguistics*

book is later called *Structural Linguistics* [@harris1963]

examples of IC: *my most recent plays closed down* (p278-279) analysed as follows, with number of dots representing separation. Reversed bloomfield approach: more dots are "larger" separation

T :: D . A : N² :. -s :.: V¹ . Pb : -ed

Complete rewrite rules (in Chomskian format, harris writes them from right to left). Note the strange early past suffix insertion. This system was already introduced in [@harris1946], but wihtout the notation for a complete sentence

Utterance → N⁴V⁴
N⁴ → TN³
N³ → N²-s
N² → AN²
A → DA
V⁴ → V²-ed
V² → V¹Pb

Insertion

T = my
D = most
A = recent
N² = play
V¹ = close
Pb = down

### Gleason (1955) *An introduction to descriptive linguistics*

[@gleason1955: 129-131]

second edition from 1961 extended, Chomsky mentioned in introduction [@gleason1961]. Includes generation and transformation. But still the old IC-stuff as well [@gleason1961]

[@gleason1965] very open description: Ch7 on Reed/Kellog and other approaches, but also many chapters on TGG

### Chomsky (1955) *The logical structure of linguistic theory*

[@chomsky1955]

Chomsky (1955: 277) Note the reversal of the usage of dashes, here more alike to brackets. The dashes seem to represent some kind of intonation structure, though.

Chomsky (1955: 316b) Similar to Pike/Fries/Hockett

Chomsky cites Bar-Hillel (1953: 57)

also in [@chomsky1975: 229, 258]

### Hockett (1958) *A course in modern linguistics*

[@hockett1958: 151-155, 178-180, 188-189]

### Francis (1958) *The structure of American English*

[@francis1958] chinese boxes. Stewart [@stewart1976] reports from personal communication with Francis, that the chinese-box diagrams were inspired on the graphical display in [@fries1952]

### Nida (1960) *A synopsis of English syntax*

[@nida1960] added images to 1943 dissertation, which did not have images

Nida (1973[1960]) writes his thesis in 1943, which is published in 1960. There do not seem to be trees in his thesis, but he Immediate Constituents might imply trees (but difficult to follow). In the 1960 edition he adds a long list of trees. But this is of course after Chomsky 1957.

In the preface of the 1943: 30 dissertation he cited Sheffield 1912 (though not with respect to structural analysis) 

Note the combination of dependency and constituency!

### Gammon (1963) *On representing syntactic structure*
