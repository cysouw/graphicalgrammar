### Barnard (1836) *Analytic Grammar*

> The method of illustrating the principles of syntax employed in the following treatise, is one which has been, for a number of years, advantageously used in the instruction of the deaf and dumb. […] The first notions of the writer regarding it, were obtained while he was engaged as an instructor in the American Asylum, at Hartford, in the years 1831 and 1832. The *method*, which it at present exhibits, has been, however, the result of a more recent labor, during the writer's residence, in a corresponding capacitiy, at the New York Institution for the Instruction of the Deaf and Dumb. [@barnard1836: iii]

Analytic Grammar; With Symbolic Illustration. New York: E. French. https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/008991837 No trees, but “symbolic sentences” in which categories are marked. Some ideas of levels http://www.polysyllabic.com/?q=node/336. Developed at school for the deaf in Hartford! based on l’epee/sicard “. This development seems to be linked to deaf-education, see [@wing1887: 86]

### March (1869) *A parser and analyzer for beginners*

### Storrs (1880) *Methods of deaf-mute teaching*

[@storrs1880; @storrs1880a; @storrs1881]

### Wing (1885) *Function symbols*

[@wing1885] further development of storrs/peet symbols for the deaf (which were also the basis for March 1869)


## Syntactic tables

### Becker (1830) *A grammar of the German language* {#sec:becker1830}

Note tables in [@becker1830: 253-261]

To describe the word order of the German sentence uses a templatic approach [see @good2016 for the term "template"].

Über die Topik der deutschen Sprache [@herling1821]

word "Topik" already in use with Roth [@roth1799: 271 ff.], who influenced Herling. Analysis of Roth is rather simplistic.

Becker [-@becker1829: 376] calls this the *Konstruktion oder Topik des Satzes* 'construction or topic of the sentence* and he also uses the expression
*topische Stellung* 'topical position'.^[This usage of the word *Topik* should not be confused with the modern linguistik usage of this term with the meaning "theme". Becker seems to have come up with this term based on the Greek meaning of *τόπος* 'place', i.e. placement of the words in a sentence. In German pronunciation, it would probably have been pronounced with a long/tense "o" instead of the short/lax "o" with which the modern term "Topik" is pronounced in German linguistics.] In the English translation, Becker [-@becker1830: 250ff.] only uses the term "construction" instead of "topic". Then, in the *Schulgrammatik* [@becker1831: 201], he uses the terms *Konstruktion oder die Wortfolge des Satzes* 'construction or word order of the sentence'. And finally, in the the *Leitfaden* [@becker1833: 66ff.], he simply calls it *Wortfolge* 'word order'.

Kopula vs. Prädikativ [@becker1829: 378]
copula vs. predicate [@becker1830: 252]
Aussagewort vs. Ausgesagtes [@becker1833: 67]

Dasjenige Objektiv, welches als das Hauptwort des ganzen Verhältnisses anzusehen ist (das Hauptobjektiv), erhält seine Stelle unmittelbar vor dem Prädikativ; und die andern Objektiven treten nach der Abstufung ihrer Unterordnung vor das Hauptobjektiv, indem jedes derselben dem ihm zunächst
übergeordneten Objektiv unmittelbar vorangeht. Im allgemeinen geht dem Begriffsworte das Formwort, dem Kasus das Orts- und Zeitadverb, dem Kasus der unmittelbar kausalen Beziehung der Kasus der mittelbar kausalen Beziehung, dem Kasus der Sache der Kasus der Person, und dem Ortsadverb das Zeitadverb voran; [@becker1829: 387-388]

### James (1847) *The elements of grammar*

"construction" in table-like manner like Becker 1830 [@james1847: 133-134]

### Morell (1852) *The analysis of sentences*

Morell [@morell1857; @morell1852] is based on Becker 1829! But simplifies into tables, and removes ordering. Tables become widespread in GB

table p24-25, complex sentence p41

### Swinton (1872) *A progressive grammar of the English tongue*

William Swinton (1833-1892) in USA (Professor of the English language in the University of California??? Preface written in New York), but no diagram - more likely britisch tradition

tabular based on Becker [@swinton1872: 154]

Swinton (1872: iii-iv) “The introduction, some thirty years ago, of the method of Sentential Analysis, devised by the German philologist Becker, and adapted to American school use in the meritorious works of Professor Greene and others, marks the only considerable innovation, in this country, on the Murray system.”

He writes many versions of grammars and textbooks, but never uses diagramming. He cites many GB-grammars (p. viii), so this work seems to belong more in that tradition

### Morris (1877) *English grammar*

Also USA, but only using tables [@morris1877: 100-111]

### Mason (1881) *English grammar*

first edition [@mason1858] no tables
25th edition [@mason1881: 183-185] with tables (fold-out appendix after p268)

### Fitch (1881) *Lectures on teaching*

long-form analysis like becker [@fitch1881: 268-269]

### Meiklejohn (1882) *The standard grammar*

graphical display "mapping" [@meiklejohn1882: 20, 22, 147, 168-169]

"mapping out" = diagramming? [@meiklejohn1886: 92, 97-98]
"continuous analysis = Becker-style? [@meiklejohn1886: 99]
tables p.98

### Cooper & Sonnenschein (1891) *An English grammar for schools*

table [@cooper1891: 9]
indentation [@cooper1891: 25]

### Davidson & Alcock (1889) *English grammar and analysis*

https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/006151225
table analysis p212, large example p220

many different books and version, first collaboration from 1873

### Nesfield (1898) *English grammar, past and present*

tables [@nesfield1898: 105-117]

### Onions (1904) *Advanced English syntax*

Charles Talbut Onions (1873-1965) Many editions, at least untill 1932

tables and indented complex sentences [@onions1904] *sentence picture* p.25

## Proto-Diagramming

### Wilbur (1814) *The grammatical alphabet*

[@wilbur1814] pictures for word classes. the "chart" mentioned could be this one: https://lccn.loc.gov/2020768232 (not digital)

[@wilbur1821] *The grammatical key* same picture for word classes, but apparently not used to draw pictures of sentences. In sentence analysis the numbers are used for parsing word classes. symbols and numbers are changed from the 1814 version

word "chart" replaced by "atlas" in furthermore exactly the same sentences.

### Brown (1831) *The American grammar*

- construing p.22: major/minor sections with different brackets p.29
- scanning (p35-40)
- scheme (p81-88), parsing

"Construing consists in dividing a sentence into sections or groups, ascertaining their true constructive relation, learning their exact significant characters, and referring the inferior sections to their respective superiors." (p. xii)

### Andrew & Stoddard (1836) *A grammar of the Latin language*

no graphics, but very concise description of dependency structure

> In analyzing a proposition, it is first to be divided into its logical subject and predicate. \
> If the logical subject consists of more than one word, its grammatical subject should be pointed out, and distinguished as simple or compound. \
> When the grammatical subject is determined, the words which modify or limit it should next be specified, and then the words which modify them, and so on, until the logical subject is exhausted. \
> In analyzing the logical predicate, the grammatical predicate should first be mentioned, then the words which modify or limit it, and their modifiers, until the logical predicate is exhausted. [@andrews1836: 254-255

::: ex
Mithridātes, duārum et viginti gentium rex, totǐdem linguis jura dixit
:::

> The logical subject is *Mithridātes duārum et viginti gentium rex*. \
> The logical predicate is *totǐdem linguis jura dixit*. \
> The grammatical subject is *Mithridātes*: this is modified by rex. Rex
is limited by *gentium*, which is itself limited by *duārum* and *viginti*.
*Et* connects *duārum* and *viginti*. \
> The grammatical predicate is *dixit*, which is limited by *jura* and *linguis*, and the latter by *totǐdem*. [@andrews1836: 255-256]

### Barrett (1837) *The principles of language*

parsing inspired by Brown???

[@barrett1837] system of parsing (introduced to the learner in the preface vii-viii), key to analysis p. 29, parsing explained p31. Text of later image on p. 33.

"scanning" on page 113.

slightly different title, but probably just a new edition[@barrett1845] insert between p.18 and 19. Parsing of the examples by letters, p.18-31

[@barrett1857], same graphic plate beween p18 and p19. Parsing exemplified p66-75

new plates: at start, before p85 in latin

note morpheme-separation by dashes in Latin p.125-131

new book [@barrett1859] proposing 21 different relations (p.28), the numbers are written to each word when parsing a sentence

### Peirce (1839) *The grammar of the English language*

"chains" on p. 50, 52, 140 [@peirce1839]

"as the dependence of words in a sentence is more fully illustrated by the following figurative exemplifications, the pupil should study them till he shall be able, without difficulty, to apply to them any simple sentences that he shall find." [@peirce1839: 47]

"immediate dependence" vs. "intermediate connection" (p. 141)

numbered example sentences p. 233-241, there appears to be some implicit hierarchical ordering, but no clear explanation. Maybe numbering like Brown?

### Alcott (1842) *Slate and black board exercises*

Alcott, William A. (William Andrus), 1798-1859. Very simple drawings in a book about using the blackboard: p. 193-194

### Greene (1846) *A treatise on the structure of the English language*

Samuel Stillman Greene (1810-1883)

cited here in printing from 1849. graphics "formula for a sentence" [@greene1849: 70, 82, 111, 120, 167, 184] meaning of digits is unclear

Later different systems, e.g.

- [@greene1860: 171-177] subject-predicate base with modifiers in brackets
- [@greene1874: 23-24] summarise structure with "significant symbols" S, P, a, o, v (cf Jespersen??? just coincidence...)

### Hall (1849) *Encyclopedia of English grammar*

"Monology" inspired by Brown! Numbering to indicate constituents ("monos") [@hall1850: 197-305]. Also bracketing with square and round brackets.

identical in 1849 version. bad scan at https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofen00hall/page/296/mode/2up?q=monology

Not the same person as William D. Hall from 1898 diagrams.

coincidence "monème" by Henri Frei *La grammaire des fautes* (1929) ???

## Diagramming

### Clark (1847) *The Science of the English Language*

Stephen W. Clark (1810-1901) was a school principal of East Bloomfield Academy and wrote the influential book *The science of the English language. A practical grammar: in which words, phrases, and sentences are classified according to their offices, and their various relations to one another. Illustrated by a complete system of diagrams.* [@clark1847] He produced revisions of this book and wrote variants for different readers up to the 1870s [e.g @clark1870, see [@mazziotta2016: 303-305 for the little that is known about Clark]. A detailed investigation of the work of Clark is available in Mazziotta [-@mazziotta2016; -@mazziotta2020a; -@mazziotta2020].

It remains unclear whether Clark has had any sources of inspiration for his graphical display. In the preface he writes that he has been testing his method at least since 1840. The "chains" of Pierce (1839)

> for the convenience of teachers a manuscript grammar was prepared, which embodied the principles of the science and the Author's mode of presenting it. These principles and this method have been properly tested by numerous and advanced classes during the seven years last past. [@clark1847: iii]

Term *office* ~ syntactic function?

He uses the term *diagram*

adjuncts are hanging, but also enclosed as boxes on p17!

[@clark1847] very interesting frontispiece in the first edition! Is later sold separately as a poster for schools

### Holbrook (1859) *The normal, or method of teaching*

Alfred Holbrook (1816-1909) first director of the National Normal University in Lebanon, Ohio.

graphical analysis [@holbrook1859: 174], citing "Brown's rules of syntax" [@holbrook1859: 165], probably Goold Brown. He also cites "Clark's grammar, revised edition", which is from 1855 (p. 104)

### Chandler (1861) *A class book on English grammar and analysis*

1860 [@chandler1860] version has no diagrams, added in revised edition 1861 [@chandler1861]

"models for black board exercises" (p151-160) very clear inspiration for later Reed/Kellog (Reed/Kellog say in introduction that their system arose in 1868, so clearly later than chandler)

### York (1862) *An Analytical, Illustrative, and Constructive Grammar*

Richard Brantley York (1805-1891) Brantley York was an educator, author, and Methodist clergyman in North Carolina. He organized Union Institute Academy at Brown's Schoolhouse in Randolph Co., N.C. in 1839, which would evolve into Normal College, Trinity College, and later Duke University.

## Immediate constituents

### Wundt (1880) *Logik* {#sec:wundt1880}

Wilhelm Maximilian Wundt (1832-1920), professor in Leipzig, was one of the founders of modern psychology, but his writings touched on a wide range of topics including language. A survey of his linguistic work is presented by Knobloch [-@knobloch1992]. As for the graphical representation of sentence structure, he wrote a few pages about this in the first volume of his book *Logik* [@wundt1880: 49-70] and later expanded upon his approach in his ten-volume magnum opus *Völkerpsychologie*, specifically, in the second volume of the two-volume book *Sprache* [-@wundt1900b: 320-355].

Wundt approaches grammatical structure in very broad and general terms. Consequently, his graphical analysis is not so much rooted in a detailed analysis of grammatical structure but rather in a-priori logical analysis, which is then applied to language. The basic unit of his analysis is the *apperceptive Verbindung* 'apperceptive connection'. The notion of apperception has a long history in the philosophy of mind, dating back at least to Leibniz. Wundt takes an almost algebraic approach to the analysis of apperception, which  might have been influenced by the "formulas" of apperceptive structures as used by Steinthal [-@steinthal1871: 198-204, 254, 388, 407-428], though Wundt does not cite this aspect of Steinthal's work. Incidentally, Wundt's *Logik* appears just a year after Frege's *Begriffsschrift* [@frege1879], which also uses graphical representations of logical formulas, though there does not seem to have been any direct influence from Frege on Wundt's thinking [see @picardi2022: 24-26 for the relatively positive view of Frege about Wundt's philosophical approach to logic and language].

For Wundt, an apperceptive connection is the basic building block of a thought, indicated visually by a connecting arch. Such a connection is introduced analytically top-down, as for Wundt a thought starts as a *Gesammtvorstellung* 'complete idea', which is subsequently divided into parts. There appears to be a direct through-line from Wundt's apperceptive connections as divisions of larger elements to the 20th century concept of syntactic "immediate constituents" first proposed by Blooomfield in 1933 (see [@sec:bloomfield1933]).

> Die einfachste Form eines Gedankens oder eines in sich abgeschlossenen apperceptiven Vorstellungsverlaufs ist dann gegeben, wenn eine Gesammtvorstellung in zwei mit einander verbundene Theile zerlegt wird. Dies geschieht im einfachen Urtheil. Deuten wir allgemein die apperceptive Verbindung auf einander folgender Vorstellungen durch das Zeichen ^⏜^ an, so ist A^⏜^B das psychologische Symbol des einfachen Urtheils. [@wundt1880: 53]
>
> ('The simplest form of a thought or a self-contained apperceptive sequence of ideas occurs when a complete idea is divided into two interconnected parts. This happens with a simple judgment. If we generally indicate the apperceptive connection of successive elements by the symbol ^⏜^, then A^⏜^B is the psychological symbol for a simple judgment.')

Such an apperceptive connection can be recursively applied, leading to a binary-branching structure of thought. This is probably the first explicit proposal to exlusively use binary branching for the analysis of though and language. Wundt even calls this the *Gesetz der Dualität* 'law of duality'. However, this law is purely a-priori in the work of Wundt. He does not give any argument why this law should apply, instead he simply assumes that binary division is the only option.

> Die successive Apperception dagegen geschieht stets in der Form einer Zweitheilung: sie folgt einem Gesetze, das wir füglich als das Gesetz der Dualität oder der binären Gliederung der Gedanken bezeichnen können. [@wundt1880: 28]
>
> ("Successive apperception, on the other hand, always occurs in the form of a division into two: it follows a law that we can aptly call the law of duality or the binary organization of thoughts.")

According to Wundt, this logical binary division is also found in the structure of linguistic utterances. His argumentation is quoted below in full, because he does not explicitly discuss various example sentences to illustrate how his syntactic analysis is supposed to work.

> Dieses Princip der Dualität oder der binären Verbindung hat in den Kategorieen der grammatischen Syntax seinen unverkennbaren Ausdruck gefunden. Denn alle diese Kategorieen führen zurück auf je zwei Vorstellungen, die mit einander in Beziehung gesetzt sind. So werden zunächst die beiden Hauptvorstellungen, die der ersten Gliederung des Gedankens entsprechen, als Subject und Prädicat unterschieden. Das Subject kann wieder gegliedert sein in Nomen und Attribut. Das Prädicat zerfällt, sofern es ein nominales ist, in die Copula und das eigentliche Prädicat, worauf sich das letztere, ähnlich dem Subject, noch einmal in Nomen und Attribut trennen kann. Ist das Prädicat aber ein verbales, so kann es sich in Verbum und Object gliedern oder in das eigentliche und das ergänzende Prädicat. Selbst da wo sich ein näheres und ein entfernteres Object mit dem Verbum verbinden, erhält sich diese fortschreitende Zweitheilang. Denn hiebei [sic!] bildet zunächst das Verbum mit dem s.g. näheren Object ein einheitliches Prädicat, welches dem entfernteren Object gegenübertritt, worauf dann erst jenes Prädicat wieder in das die Handlung ausdrückende Verbum und in das Object, auf welches sich die Handlung beziebt, getrennt wird. In dem Satz 'er unterrichtet den Knaben in Musik' bildet 'er unterrichtet in Musik' zunächst eine einheitliche Vorstellung, die den Knaben als das Object, auf das sie bezogen wird, sich gegenüber hat; dann erst zerlegt sich jene Vorstellung wieder in ihre beiden Bestandteile. [@wundt1880: 54]
>
> ("This principle of duality or binary connection has found its unmistakable expression in the categories of grammatical syntax. For all these categories lead back to two concepts that are related to one another. Thus, the two main concepts corresponding to the initial division of thought are distinguished as subject and predicate. The subject can be further divided into noun and attribute. The predicate, insofar as it is nominal, is divided into the copula and the proper predicate, the latter of which, similar to the subject, can again be divided into noun and attribute. If, however, the predicate is verbal, it can be divided into verb and object, or into the proper and the complementary predicate. Even where a closer and a more distant object combine with the verb, this progressive division is maintained. For here, the verb initially forms a unified predicate with the so-called nearer object, which contrasts with the more distant object. Only then is that predicate separated again into the verb expressing the action and the object to which the action refers. In the sentence 'he teaches music to the boy' the part 'he teaches music' initially forms a unified concept, which has the boy as the object to which it refers; only then does that concept break down again into its two components.")

The equivalence between syntactic structure and binary-branching subject-predicate structures is illustrated graphically by Wundt as shown in [@fig:wundt1893_62]. A syntactic structure is shown to the left, which is proposed to be equivalent to the logical structure to the right. This graphic does not explicitly analyse a specific sentence, but from the text it is clear that a sentence like [@next] is intended. The abbreviations from the graphic are added in grey into this examples sentence. The meanings of these abbreviations as explained by Wundt are listed below [-@wundt1880: 55-56].^[The usage of apostrophes is eerily similar to the way they were sometimes used as an easier-to-type alternative in Chomsky's X-bar approach from the 1980s. However, this seems to be a purely coincidental parallel.] It is not completely clear where Wundt would place the actual lexical verb into this structure. From a modern point of view it makes most sense to consider *v* and *v'* as phrasal constituents, while the leaf-node *v"* is the locus of the lexical verb. However, Wundt's text remains ambigious about this. He does not use a syntactic term like "constituent" at all and all three nodes marked *v* are identically called *Verbalvorstellung* 'verbal concept'.

- s: *Gegenstandsvorstellung*
- a: *Attribut*
- v: *Verbalvorstellung*
- v': *Verbalvorstellung zweiter Ordnung*
- v'': *Verbalvorstellung dritter Ordnung*
- o: *entfernteres Object*
- o': *näheres Object*
- a': *adverbiale Bestimmung*

The graphic shown here is from second edition because of better printing quality [@wundt1893: 62]. Wundt does not provide an explicit German sentence, whose structure would be illustrated with this graphic, but from Wundt's description an example sentence like [@last] can be inferred.
:::

Wundt extends his linguistic analysis into two large volumes in his book *Sprache*, which start off his ten-volume *Völkerpsychologie*. Specifically in the second volume [@wundt1900b] he dives deep into grammatical analysis. In Chapter 7, Section 5 *Gliederung des Satzes und Satzformen* [@wundt1900b: 309-346] he revisits his graphical approach to the analysis of syntax. Confusingly, Wundt does not repeat the basic analysis of a simple sentence, as presented above from his 1880 work. Instead, there is a lengthy discussion of porported structures from a few "exotic" languages like Wolof and Jakut, but only using very crude German glossings of the original examples, never once even citing any real sentence from those languages.

Wundt discusses two more elaborate examples of his syntactic analysis using sentences from Goethe's *Die Leiden des jungen Werthers*, repeated here in [@next a,b]. These sentences are typical examples as found in 19th century German grammatical analysis, consisting of multiple subordinate clauses. The graphical analysis of these sentences is shown in [@fig:wundt1900_351a] and [@fig:wundt1900_351b], respectively. The annotation letters in the example sentences in [@next] are reproduced here verbatim as used by Wundt to explain the relation between the sentences and the graphical analysis. After the first example he concludes that his (very short) description is sufficient to explain his analytical approach. Instead of explaining his second example, he simple states: *das ergibt folgende Strukturformel, die nach dem Vorangegangenen wohl keines weiteren Kommentars bedarf* 'this results in the following structural formula, that – given the preceding discussion – does not need any further explanation' [@wundt1900b: 351]. However, quite to the contrary, on closer inspection his syntactic analysis is difficult to follow and quite sloppy. It comes nowhere near the highly precise dissections as found in the works of many of the 19th century German syntacticians.

Graphical analysis of [@last a] from Wundt [-@wundt1900b: 351]. The capital letter *G* stands for *Gesammtvorstellung* 'complete idea' and is used for what today would be called a clause. This example is actually unusual (as explicitly noted by Wundt), because the sentence is syntactically incomplete, as indicated by the empty right part of the main bracket. The arches and straight-line connections are applied rather inconsistently, indicating that Wundt did not realy grasp how a constituency analysis (in its modern sense) works.

Graphical analysis of [@last b] from Wundt [-@wundt1900b: 351]. He introduces (without explanation) round brackets for non-repeated subjects on the left side. This graphical analysis seems to use to old tradition to reserve capital letters for main clauses and lowercase letters for subordinate clauses, a convention originally introduced by Lehmann in 1833 (see [@sec:lehmann1833]). However, this convention is never explained by Wundt.
:::

These syntactic analyses by Wundt are very inprecise and inconsistent, indicating that Wundt was not really interested in the minute details of the syntactic structure of these sentences. He appears to be confused about what is a *Gesammtvorstellung* (i.e. what is a clausal constituent), what are its parts, and how the various clauses relate to each other. For clause combinations, Wundt distinguishes [-@wundt1900b: 334] *Parataxe* (including conjunction, using a straight line), *Relativsatz* (relative clause, using some kind of subscript in the analysis) and *conjunctiver Nebensatz* (adverbial clauses, using the curved arch). He never mentions complement clauses, but in [@fig:wundt1900_351b] he simply positions those below the matric clause. Wundt also talks about *attributive Satzformen* (non-finite clauses), but he only discusses rather incomprehensible examples from non-european languages, without any details and only on the basis of crude German glossing. The lowercase letters appear intended to indicate subject and predicate of a subordinate clause, which together should form a clause, for which he sometimes (but not always) uses the uppercase *G*. However, all these visual mechanisms are applied haphazardly, and often simply erroneously. It would take too long to explain all errors in Wundt's analyses, so I will just point to a few of the many problems.

In the first sentence, the topmost clause *G* is actually incomplete (as explicitly noted by Wundt) because the main clause is missing. This is (correctly) indicated by the empty right side of the main arch. However, different from Wundt's analysis, the left (subordinate) side consists of two long conditional clauses introduced by *wenn*. These two should have been marked as being conjoined as a *Parataxe*. The internal structure of these two *wenn* clauses is complemently wrong in Wundt's analysis.

In the second example Wundt does not use any internal capital letter *G*, but there are uppercase letters *A,B,C,D*, probably indicating subject and predicate of main clauses. This is reminiscent of the Lehmann tradition, using capital letters for main clauses and lowercase for subordinate clauses (see [@sec:lehmann1833]). On the left side, the lowercase *(a)* in brackets seems to suggest an omitted subject, though the subject of predicate *d* is actually present. Wundt also appears to mark complements clauses (introduced with *daß*) by simply positioning them below their matrix clauses (without explanation), but erroneously links the last main clause *(A^⏜^D)* to the complement clause, instead of to the main clause *(A^⏜^C)*. The use of the subscripts on the right side seems superfluous.

German grammarians are not impressed by Wundt's linguistic analysis, and his graphical analysis is completely ignored. Extensive reviews of Wundt's book *Sprache* are written by Delbrück [-@delbruck1901] and Sütterlin [-@sutterlin1902], leading to a lengthy reply by Wundt [-@wundt1901] and by his student Dittrich [-@dittrich1902]. Only Dittrich in passing mentions the graphical approach. Delbrück off-handedly dismisses the idea of binary branching: *Ich bin demnach der Meinung, daß dieses ganze Princip der fortgesetzten binären Zerlegung […] durch die sprachlichen Thatsachen nicht empfohlen wird* 'I am therefore of the opinion that this entire principle of continued binary decomposition […] is not recommended by linguistic facts' [@delbruck1901: 153-154].

Although Wundt's graphical analysis does not have had any direct followers (except for Sheffield in the USA, [@sec:sheffield1912]), his general approach seems to have influenced Bloomfield ([@sec:bloomfield1933]) and via Bloomfield it has influenced the tradition of *immediate constituents* in the USA, directly leading to Chomsky's generative grammar in the 1960. Specifically the idea of an exclusively binary subdivisions of sentences, a major tenet of Chomsky's approach, is probably directly attributable to Wundt (apparently without Chomsky knowing about this).

### Sheffield (1912) *Grammar and thinking* {#sec:sheffield1912}

[@bloomfield1933: 160-161] slowly builds up the terminology, which seems to indicate that the terminology is newly developed for this book. He starts with *constituent (or component)* which is *contained in* or *included in* complex forms. The basic building blocks are morphemes, which cannot be further subdivided, and are called *ultimate constituents*. Then, finally, any intermediate grouping are called *immediate constituents*.

[@bloomfield1914: 60-61], cited in Percival (1976:235) clearly thinks about binary branching. Also note the Wundt-inspired psychological reasoning, also using the term "apperception" (p.60).

Hypothesis that Wundt influenced Bloomfield: [@percival1976: 234-235 gives various detailed arguments], but again no pictures. The basic assumption of binary analysis pervasive in US-american 20th century analyses can probably be tracked back to Wundt.

[@gleason1955: 129-131] also accompanying workbook (no graphics)

second edition from 1961 extended, Chomsky mentioned in introduction [@gleason1961]. Includes generation and transformation. But still the old IC-stuff as well [@gleason1961]

Chomsky (1955: 277) Note the reversal of the usage of dashes, here more alike to brackets.

Chomsky (1955: 316b) Similar to Pike/Fries/Hockett

### Francis (1958) *The structure of American English*

[@francis1958] chinese boxes. Stewart [@stewart1976] reports from personal communication with Francis, that the chinese-box diagrams were inspired on the graphical display in [@fries1952]

### Nida (1960) *A synopsis of English syntax*

[@nida1960] added images to 1943 dissertation, which did not have images

Nida (1973[1960]) writes his thesis in 1943, which is published in 1960. There do not seem to be trees in his thesis, but he Immediate Constituents might imply trees (but difficult to follow). In the 1960 edition he adds a long list of trees. But this is of course after Chomsky 1957.

In the preface of the 1943: 30 dissertation he cited Sheffield 1912 (though not with respect to structural analysis) 

Note the combination of dependency and constituency!

### Gammon (1963) *On representing syntactic structure*
